He firmly believed as he put it, that “there is nothing incomprehensible about the universe,” and through painstaking work, explained many of the phenomena thought to be “incomprehensible” in his day. Einstein was also never afraid to admit mistakes when facts proved his theories wrong.</p><p>Second, Einstein’s contributions showed the great importance of theoretical work to scientific effort. Although he himself rarely worked in laboratories, the concepts he developed led to many of the scientific advances which have shaped modern technology.</p><p>Third, Einstein believed very deeply that scientists must have a moral and social consciousness. In this way, he provided inspiration for a whole generation of scientists who became active in the Communist movement.</p><p>Einstein is often portrayed in bourgeois writings as a “genius” whose theories are so complicated that no one but a few best scientists can understand them. But he himself rejected the efforts to put him in a position far above other people. He was well known for his humble manner and often stressed to interviewers that his accomplishments would certainly have been achieved by others had he never lived.</p><p>Actually, Einstein’s theory of relativity and his other scientific works are not that hard to understand with a little study. But beyond learning Einstein’s theories, his overall attitude towards science as a tool to liberate humanity is something from which everyone can and should learn.</p><p>(2)</p><p>Between now and the end of the century, there will be many exciting developments and also many difficult problems to deal with. Perhaps the most urgent problem is to provide enough food. The world’s population is expected to reach 7,000 million by the year 2000, but already scientists have produced new and better varieties of wheat and rice and animal. They have also been experimenting with techniques of cultivating plants by using mixtures of chemical compounds and water only, and then there will be no need for ordinary soil. Another problem which the world will face is to get rid of refuse (废料). One solution is to burn refuse at very high temperatures in incinerators (焚化炉). A development of this, which may prove very useful in the future, is to use these incinerators to generate steam power. In fact, any new source of energy will be very welcome, as there is already a shortage of petroleum. To solve the energy problem, scientists will probably also try to make more use of solar energy.</p><p>The possible effects of some scientific fields, such as lasers and cryogenics (低温学), are difficult to imagine and both already have a number of uses. The supercooling effects of the cryogenics which convert liquid helium (液态氦) and other gases into “superfluids” and metals into “superconductors”, making them non-resistant to electricity, could change the world in a number of ways. The laser, with its beam of strong light, can drill a hole in a diamond, and yet can be so well controlled that it can be used in delicate eye operations. The question is whether it will be most used for peaceful purposes or as a deadly weapon.</p><p>But perhaps the most remarkable developments will occur in space flight. One of the difficulties in the past has been the high cost, but now the space shuttle is being developed, and can be used a large number of times instead of only once. Already man has been to the moon. Perhaps by the end of the century he will have had a close-up view of Venus (金星) or Mars (火星).</p>]]></content>

(30 points)(1)In country after country, talk of non-smokers’ right is in the air. While a majority of countries have taken little or no action yet, some 30 nations have introduced legislative steps to control smoking. Many laws have been introduced in other countries to help clear the air for nonsmokers, or to cut cigarette consumption.In some developed countries the consumption of cigarettes has become more or less stabilized. However, in many developing nations, cigarette smoking is seen as a sign of economic progress — and is even encouraged. As more tobacco companies go international, new markets are sought to gain new smokers in those countries. For example, great efforts are made by the American tobacco industry to sell cigarettes in the Middle East and North Africa — where U.S. tobacco exports increased by more than 27 percent in 1974.Smoking is harmful to the health of people. World governments should conduct serious campaigns against it. Restrictions on cigarette advertisements, plus health warnings on packages and bans on public smoking in certain places such as theatres, cinemas and restaurants, are the most popular tools used by nations in support of nonsmokers or in curbing smoking. But world attention also is focusing on another step which will make the smoker increasingly self-conscious and uncomfortable about his habit. Great efforts should be made to inform young people especially of the dreadful consequences of taking up the habit. And cigarette price should be boosted.In the long run, there is no doubt that everybody would be much better-off if smoking were banned altogether, but people are not ready for such drastic action.(2)Nuclear power’s danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be summed up in one word: radiation.Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can’t be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can’t detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can’t sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage many not be significant. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in a deformed way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak or liable to serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth.</code></pre>]]></content>

(40 points)</p><p>(1)</p><p>The United Kingdom is a monarchical (君主政体的) State. It is one of the independent members of the Commonwealth (the Queen is recognized as head of the Commonwealth), and a member of the European Community.</p><p>The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each of the four parts that make up the country: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. England was united as a kingdom a thousand years ago, and Wales became part of the kingdom during the middle ages. The thrones (王位) of England and Scotland were united in 1603, and in 1707 legislation passed in the two countries provided for the establishment of a single Parliament of Great Britain with supreme authority both in England and Wales and in Scotland. Ireland had had links with the kingdom of England since the thirteenth century, and in 1800 the creation of the United Kingdom was completed by a union joining the Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain. In 1922 Southern Ireland (now the Irish Republic) became a self-governing country. The six counties of Northern Ireland had in 1920 been given their own subordinate Parliament, and voted to remain within the United Kingdom.</p><p>The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster in London — with an elected chamber comprising members from English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland constituencies (选举区) — therefore represents people sharing very varied backgrounds and traditions. It has ultimate authority for government and law-making, but administrative arrangements have developed in such a way as to take account of the particular needs of different areas.</p><p>England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other have different systems of law, different court systems, different education systems, different systems of local government and, for most domestic matters, different government departments.</p><p>(2)</p><p>As more people live closer together, and as they use machines to produce leisure, they find that their leisure, and even their working hours, become spoilt by a by-product of their machines — namely, noise. Noise is nowadays in the news; it has acquired political status, and public opinion is demanding, more and more insistently, that something must be done about it.</p><p>To control noise is to demand much self-discipline (annoyance arises often from lack of common courtesy), a sense of proportion (there is usually a conflict of interest if a noise is to be stopped), the expenditure of money (and it is far more economical to do this early rather that late), and finally, technical knowledge.</p><p>Technical difficulties often arise from the subjective-objective nature of the problem. You can define the excessive speed of a motor-car in terms of a pointer reading on a speedometer. But can you define excessive noise in the same way? You find that with any existing simple “noise-meter”, vehicles which are judged to be equally noisy may show considerable difference on the meter.</p><p>Though the ideal cure for noise is to stop it at its source, this may in many cases be impossible. The next remedy is to absorb it on its way to the ear.</p><p>Domestic noises may perhaps be controlled by forethought and courtesy, and industrial noises by good planning and technical improvement. But if we are going to allow fast motor-cycles and heavy diesel lorries to pass continuously trough residential and business districts, the community must decide on the control it needs to exercise, for in the long run it has got to pay for it. And if a nation is to take part in modern air transport, it must enter into international agreements on the noise control measures it will impose at its airports — and here the cost of any real control is to be measured in millions of dollars.</p><p>(3)</p><p>About 350 years ago Galileo made a telescope and looked through it at the sun. What he saw both surprised and frightened him, for he saw dark spots on the sun which at once suggested to him that God had not made the world quite as perfect as he had previously believed. He hesitated to make his discovery known. Meanwhile other scientists noticed the same lack of solar perfection and proclaimed (宣布) the fact.</p><p>But Galileo continued his observations and was soon rewarded with another discovery. Fixing his attention on a single sunspot (太阳黑子) group, he noticed that in a few days it had moved in position, just as if the sun itself were turning. Afterwards he found a sunspot group which lived long enough to disappear from view on the western limb (边缘) of the sun, to re-appear on its eastern limb, and finally to regain its old position. This led him to conclude that the sun itself was rotating and that the time it took to make one complete turn was about twenty-five to twenty-seven days. Actually we know from the drawings which Galileo made of sunspots that there must have been quite a lot of them at the time of his observations in the years 1611 and 1612. If he had gone on making his drawings in the years that immediately followed, we know that he would almost certainly have noticed that sunspots were becoming fewer and smaller. But he became interested in other things and so he failed to recognize that there is a kind of long-term cycle in sunspot activity, the sunspots increasing and decreasing as the years go on. Later this discovery of the sunspot activity was made by one of the most patient observers in the history of science, a German chemist, Charles Schwabe.</p>]]></content>

(25 points)<br>​    (1)<br>​    Let us suppose that you are in the position of a parent. Would you allow your children to read any book they wanted to without first checking its contents? Would you take your children to see any film without first finding out whether it is suitable for them? If your answer to these questions is ‘yes’, then you are just plain irresponsible. If your answer is ‘no’, then you are exercising your right as a parent to protect your children from what you consider to be undesirable influences. In other words, by acting as an examiner yourself, you are admitting that there is a strong case for censorship.<br>​    Now, of course, you will say that it is one thing to exercise censorship where children are concerned and quite another to do the same for adults. Children need protection and it is the parents’ responsibility to provide it. But what about adults? Aren’t they old enough to decide what is good for them? The answer is that many adults are, but don’t make the mistake of thinking that all adults are like yourself. Censorship is for the good of society as a whole. Like the law, it contributes to the common good.<br>​    Some people think that it is a shame that a censor should interfere with works of art. But we must bear in mind that the great proportion of books, plays and films which come before the censor are very far from being ‘works of art’.<br>​    When censorship laws are relaxed, dishonest people are given a chance to produce virtually anything in the name of ‘art’. One of the great things that censorship does is to prevent certain people from making fat profits by corrupting the minds of others. To argue in favour of absolute freedom is to argue in favour of anarchy. Society would really be the better if it were protected by correct censorship.<br>​    (2)<br>​    If the sun has enough power to warm and light the whole earth, it must have enough power to do other things, too. Can we use the sun’s abundant energy to supply electricity, or at least to perform the functions which electricity or other types of power usually perform? The answer is yes.<br>​    For example, people have for many years been using the reflected heat of the sun to cook by. Solar cookers have been built with several curved mirrors reflecting the sun and focusing its heat on the cooking element. This apparatus can be used just like a gas or electric stove; it is more expensive to make but it does not need any fuel, and so costs nothing to use. Another possibility of using solar energy is in house-heating.<br>​    The form of energy we use most is electricity, and every day more is needed. But electricity has to be made, too, and to make it huge quantities of fuel are required — oil, coal, gas and nowadays even uranium.<br>​    The question which worries everyone today is: how long will these fuels last? Nobody knows for sure, but most experts think it will soon be difficult to obtain sufficient electricity from these sources. It is possible that the sun can make a contribution here, too.<br>​    Solar power has already been used to produce terrific hat. In Southern France a solar furnace has been built, where temperatures reach more than 3000° Centigrade. This furnace is only used for experiments at present, but could be used to produce steam for a power station.<br>​    So it is possible that one day in the near future we will depend on solar furnaces and power stations to provide our electrical needs. Or perhaps each home will have a solar generator to provide power for lighting and heating.</p>]]></content>

Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)</p><p><strong>(1)</strong></p><p>(81) Electricity is such a part of our everyday lives and so much taken for granted nowadays that we rarely think twice when we switch on the light or turn on the radio. At night, roads are brightly lit, enabling people and traffic to move freely. Neon lighting used in advertising has become part of the character of every modern city. In the home, many labour-saving devices are powered by electricity. (82) Even when we turn off the bedside lamp and are fat asleep, electricity is working for us, driving our refrigerators, heating our water, or keeping our rooms air-conditioned. Every day, trains, trolley-buses, and trams take us to and from work. (83) We rarely bother to consider why or how they run until something goes wrong.</p><p>One summer something did go wrong with the power plant that provides New York with electricity. For a great many hours, life came almost to a standstill. Trains refused to move and the people in them sat in the dark, powerless to do anything; (84) lifts stopped working, so that even if you were lucky enough not to be trapped between two floors, you had the unpleasant task of finding your way down hundreds of flights of stairs. Famous streets like Broadway and Fifth Avenue in an instant became as gloomy and uninviting as the most remote back streets. (85) People were afraid to leave their houses, for although the police had been ordered to stand by in case of emergency, they were just as confused and helpless as anybody else.</p><p>Meanwhile, similar disorder prevailed in the home. New York can be stifling in the summer and this year was no exception. Cool, air-conditioned apartments became furnaces. Food went bad in refrigerators. Cakes and joints of meat remained uncooked in cooling ovens. (86) People sat impatient and frightened in the dark as if an unseen enemy had landed from Mars. (87) One of the strange things that occurred during the power-cut was that some fifty blind people lead many sighted workers home. (88) When the lights came on again, hardly a person in the city can have turned on a switch without reflecting how great a servant he had at his fingertips.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong></p><p>A mineral is a material that is mined, not grown. (89) In other words mineral substances which are found on the earth must be extracted by digging, boring holes, artificial explosions, or similar operations which make them available to us. Some minerals, for example coal and oil, were originally living substances; others, like iron, never had life. (90) Coal and oil are the remains of plants and animals. Crude mineral ores and crude oil must be purified before they can be used.</p><p>(91) A stage in human civilization is often called by the name of the substance mainly used at that stage: the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and so on. The level of civilization reached by a society depends on the materials it can use, not only on those which are available. (92) The capacity to use a raw material depends on various factors, such as means of access, methods of extraction, and techniques of processing. In order to be purified, or combined into alloys, metals must be melted. For this purpose they must be placed in containers which can be heated to enormous temperatures. These containers or enclosed spaces are called furnaces. (93) Plants which refine crude ores are often located in countries other than those in which the crude ores are mined.</p><p>Although much was known previously about the chemical properties of aluminum and their application to practical uses, (94) it was not until sixty years ago that a method of extracting aluminum ore was found which could lead to a cheap large-scale process.</p><p>(95) In the past few decades men behaved as if their supplies of minerals were inexhaustible. (96) But now it is realized that supplies of some of them are limited, and it is even possible to give a reasonable estimate of their “expectation of life,” the time it will take to exhaust all known sources and reserves of these materials.</p><p>But in the case of minerals it is especially difficult to give a reliable estimate of reserves because surveys have not been completed and it is not certain that all sources are known. Uranium provides a good example of this fact.</p>]]></content>

He tore the poem up, with a  not to waste time in his lesson. All the same I was convinced that I had written a good poem, so that evening I wrote it out again from memory. Not long after, I read about a poetry contest and I decided to send in my poem. Weeks later, long after I had given up hope, I got a letter informing me I had won first .

But television, like other things, has both advantages and disadvantages. Do the former outweigh the latter?<br>    In the first place, television is not only a convenient source of entertainment, but also a comparatively cheap one. (66) For a family of four, for example, it is more convenient as well as cheaper to sit comfortably at home, with almost unlimited entertainment available, than to go out in search of amusement elsewhere. (67) They do not have to pay for expensive seats at the theatre, the cinema, or the opera, only to discover, perhaps, that the show is disappointing. (68) All they have to do is press a button, and they can see plays, films, operas, and shows of every kind, not to mention political discussions and the latest exciting football match. (69) Some people, however, maintain that this is precisely where the danger lies. The television viewer takes no initiative. He makes no choice and exercises no judgment. (70) He is completely passive and has everything presented to him without any effort on his part.<br>    (71) Television, it is often said, keeps one informed about current events, allows one to follow the latest developments in science and politics, and offers and endless series of programs which are both instructive and entertaining. The most distant countries and the strangest custom are brought right into one’s sitting-room. (72) It could be argued that the radio performs this service just as well; but on television everything is much more living, much more real. Yet here again there a danger. We get so used to looking at it, so dependent on its flickering pictures, that it begins to dominate our lives.<br>    There are many other arguments for and against television. The poor quality of its programs is often criticized. But it is undoubtedly a great comfort to many lonely elderly people. And does it corrupt or instruct our children? I think we must realize that television in itself is neither good nor bad. (73) It is the uses to which it is put that determine its value to society.<br>(2)<br>    An office is the “Brain” of a business. (74) In an office, figures, lists and information are compiled which tell the managers or heads of the business what is happening in their shops or factories. These figures guide the managers by telling them what has happened and what is happening.<br>    Information comes into an office in all sorts of ways but the main items of information come in regularly. (75) It is part of the job of the clerks to collect and classify that information and to put it into such a form that it is easily interpreted and understood. Offices collect information then they classify it.<br>    This work of collection is common in an office from the sorting of mail every morning to the accountant’s work in finding out the final figure for the year’s profit. (76) Classification always requires the arrangement of the same kind of information, often into lists or columns. (77) For this work, correctness, accuracy and speed, as in all office work, are essential.<br>    There is no value, however, in collecting figures which mean nothing. Figures are guides which should help we make decisions. (78) The interpretation of information and of tables should tell us where success or failure lies, where profit can be had and where losses occur. (79) On this kind of information and from the known figures, a choice is made and a series of such choices may make a policy.<br>    A firm which has three factories may find, for instance, from its figures, that one factory is losing money and a choice may lie between either a change of manager, a cut in production, an increase in production or closure of the factory. Whichever one of these decisions is taken becomes the policy. (80) It is clear that a decision leading to a policy can only be as good as the information on which it is based.<br>    Consequently there is a constant search for more and more exact information. (81) Managers will want to have all the necessary facts before they can make the best decision and it is normal for them to seek for more and more information.</p>]]></content>

thousands of spectators gathered from all parts of Greece, but no married woman was admitted even as a spectator. ③Slaves, women and dishonored persons were not allowed to compete. ④The exact sequence

circumstances they are electrified, we have told all there is to tell.” ⑥Until recently scientists would have disapproved of such an idea. ⑦Aristotle, for example, whose natural science dominated Western thought for two thousand years, believed that man could arrive at an understanding of reality by reasoning from self-evident principles. ⑧He felt, for example, that it is a self-evident principle that everything in the universe has its proper place, hence one can deduce that objects fall to the ground because that’s where they belong, and smoke goes up because that’s where it belongs. ⑨The goal of Aristotelian science was to explain why things happen. ⑩Modern science was born when Galileo began trying to explain how things happen and thus originated the method of

Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)*</strong></em></p><p>Have there always been cities? (26) Life without large urban areas may seem inconceivable to us, but actually cities are relatively recent development. Groups with primitive economics still manage without them. The trend, however, is for such groups to disappear, while cities are increasingly becoming the dominant mode of man’s social existence. (27) Historically, city life has always been among the elements which form a civilization. Any high degree of human endeavor and achievement has been closely linked to life in an urban environment. (28) It is virtually impossible to imagine that universities, hospitals, large businesses or even science and technology could have come into being without cities to support them. To most people, cities have traditionally been the areas where there was a concentration of culture as well as of opportunity. (29) In recent years, however, people have begun to become aware that cities are also areas where there is a concentration of problems. What has happened to the modern American city? Actually, the problem is not such a new one. Long before this century started, there had begun a trend toward the concentration of the poor of the American society into the cities. Each great wave of immigration from abroad and from the rural areas made the problem worse. During this century, there has also been the development of large suburban areas surrounding the cities, for the rich prefer to live in these areas. Within the cities, sections may be sharply divided into high and low rent districts, the “right side of town” and the slums.</p><p>Of course, everyone wants to do something about this unhappy situation. But there is no agreement as to goals. Neither is there any systematic approach or integrated program. Opinions are as diverse as the people who give them. (30) But one basic difference of opinion concerns the question of whether or not the city as such is to be preserved. Perhaps transportation and the means of communication have really made it possible for there to be an end to the big cities. Of course, there is the problem of persuading people to move out of them of their own free will. (31) And there is also the objection that the city has always been the core from which cultural advancement has radiated. Is this, however, still the case today in the presence of easy transportation and communication? Does culture arise as a result of people living together communally, or is it too the result of decisions made at the level of government and the communications industry?</p><p>It is probably true to say that most people prefer to preserve the cities. Some think that the cities could be cleaned up or totally rebuilt. This is easy to say; it would not be so easy to do. (32) To be sure, a great rebuilding project would give jobs to many of those people who need them. Living conditions could not help but improve, at least for a while. But would the problems return after the rebuilding was completed?</p><p>Nevertheless, with the majority of the people living in urban areas, the problem of the cities must be solved. (33) From agreement on this general goal, we have, unfortunately, in the past proceeded to disagreement on specific goals, and from there to total inaction. At the basis of much of this inaction is an old-fashioned concept – the idea human conditions will naturally tend to regulate themselves for the general goal.</p>]]></content>

than one per cent of its area. ⑤Antarctica differs fundamentally from the Arctic regions. ⑥The Arctic is an ocean, covered with drifting packed ice and hemmed in by the land masses of Europe, Asia, and North America. ⑦The Antarctic is a continent almost as large as Europe and Australia combined, centered roughly on the South Pole and surrounded by the most unobstructed water areas of the world – the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.</p><p>①The continental ice sheet is more than two miles high in its centre, thus, the air over the Antarctic is far more refrigerated than it is over the Arctic regions. ②This cold air current from the land is so forceful that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the world and renders unlivable those regions whose counterparts at the opposite end of the globe are inhabited. ③Thus, more than a million persons live within 2,000 miles of the North Pole in an area that includes most of Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia – a region rich in forest and mining industries. ④Apart from a handful of weather stations, within the same distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or settlement.</p><table><thead><tr><th

Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)</p><p>It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to university without any clear idea of what they are going to do afterwards. (21) If one considers the enormous variety of courses offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is for a student to select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. (22) If a student goes to university to acquire a broader perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to think for himself, he will undoubtedly benefit. (23) Schools often have too restricting an atmosphere, with its time tables and disciplines, to allow him much time for independent assessment of the work he is asked to do. (24) Most students would, I believe, profit by a year of such exploration of different academic studies, especially those “all rounders” with no particular interest. They should have longer time to decide in what subject they want to take their degrees, so that in later life, they do not look back and say, “I should like to have been an archaeologist. If I hadn’t taken a degree in Modern Languages, I shouldn’t have ended up as an interpreter, but it’s too late now. I couldn’t go back and begin all over again.”</p><p>(25) There is, of course, another side to the question of how to make the best use of one’s time at university. (26) This is the case of the student who excels in a particular branch of learning. (27) He is immediately accepted by the University of his choice, and spends his three or four years becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honour Degree and very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. (28) It therefore becomes more and more important that, if students are not to waste their opportunities, there will have to be much more detailed information about courses and more advice. Only in this way can we be sure that we are not to have, on the one hand, a band of specialists ignorant of anything outside of their own subject, and on the other hand, an ever increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is little or no demand in the working world.</p>]]></content>

Living   5   began to improve in the spring of 1621. There were wild vegetables. There were berries and fruit. Fish and game were plentiful. Therefore, they were able to get enough fresh meat despite their lack of skill or experience in hunting and fishing.

Only fifty of the original one hundred passengers remained. The price in human life and tragedy had been great. On the other hand, they saw new hope for the future. A splendid harvest was   8   them. They were ready for the second winter with confidence. They had eleven crude houses for protection against the severe winter. Seven were for families, and four were for communal use.   9  , they had established a treaty of friendship with their Indian neighbors under Chief Massasoit in the summer.<br>The woods and forests became safe. When the Mayflower returned to England that summer, there were no colonists   10  . At the end of their first year in their new home, the Pilgrims wanted to celebrate with a real holiday.

I’m just looking”? ②Both you and she know that if you aren’t sure what you want, you are not likely to find it. ③But suppose you say instead, “Yes, thank you. I want a pair of sun glasses.” ④She says, “Right this way, please.” ⑤And you and she are off – both eager to look for exactly what you want.<br>①It’s quite the same with your studying. ②If you chose a book at random, “just looking” for nothing in particular, you are likely to get just that – nothing. ③But if you do know what you want, and if you have the right book, you are almost sure to get it. ④Your reasons will vary; they will include reading or studying “to find out more about”, “to understand the reasons for”, “to find out how”. ⑤A good student has a clear purpose or reason for what he is doing.<br>①This is the way it works. ②Before you start to study, you say to yourself something like this, “I want to know why Stephen Vincent Benet happened to write about America. I’m reading this article to find out.” ③Or, “I’m going to skim this story to see what life was like in medieval England.” ④Because you know why you are reading or studying, you relate the information to your purpose and remember it better.<br>①Reading is not one single activity. ②At least two important processes go on at the same time. ③As you read, you take in ideas rapidly and accurately. ④But at the same time you express your own ideas to yourself as you react to what you read. ⑤You have a kind of mental conversation with the author. ⑥If you expressed your ideas orally, they might sound like this: “Yes, I agree. That’s my opinion too.” or “Ummmm, I thought that record was broken much earlier. I’d better check those dates,” or “But there are some other facts to be considered!” ⑦You don’t just sit there taking in ideas – you do something else, and that something else is very important.<br>①This additional process of thinking about what you read includes evaluating it, relating it to what you already know, and using it for your own purposes. ②In other words, a good reader is a critical reader. ③One part of critical reading, as you have discovered, is distinguishing between facts and opinions. ④Facts can be checked by evidence. ⑤Opinions are one’s own personal reactions.<br>①Another part of critical reading is judging sources. ②Still another part is drawing accurate inferences.</p><p>11.If you cannot remember what you read or study, ________.<br>[A] it is no surprise<br>[B] it means you have not really learned anything<br>[C] it means you have not chosen the right book<br>[D] you realize it is of no importance</p><p>12.Before you start reading, it is

of its influence on human behavior. ②Although everyone more or less knows what noise is, i.e., it is sounds that one would rather not hear, it is perhaps best to define it more precisely for scientific purposes. ③One such definition is that noise is sounds that are unrelated to the task at hand. ④Thus stimuli that at one time might be considered relevant will at another time be considered noise, depending on what one is doing at the moment. ⑤In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the effects of noise on human behavior, and concepts such as “noise pollution” have arisen, together with movements to reduce noise.<br>①Exposure to loud noises can definitely produce a partial or complete loss of hearing, depending on the intensity, duration, and frequency composition of the noise. ②Many jobs present noise hazards, such as working in factories and around jet aircraft, driving farm tractors, and working (or sitting) in music halls where rock bands are playing. ③In general, continuous exposure to sounds of over 80 decibels (a measure of the loudness of sound) can be considered dangerous. ④Decibel values correspond to various sounds. ⑤Sounds above about 85 decibels may, if exposure is for a sufficient period of time, produce significant hearing loss. ⑥Actual loss will depend upon the particular frequencies to which one is exposed, and whether the sound is continuous or intermittent.<br>Noise can have unexpected harmful effects on performance of certain kinds of tasks, for instance, if one is performing a watch keeping task that requires vigilance, in which he is responsible for detecting weak signals of some kind (e.g., watching a radar screen for the appearance of aircraft).<br>①Communicating with other people is unfavorably affected by noise. ②If you have ridden in the rear of a jet transport, you may have noticed that it was difficult to carry on a conversation at first, and that, eventually, you adjusted the loudness of your speech to compensate for the effect. ③The problem is noise.</p><p>15.Noise differs from sound in that ________.<br>[A] it is sounds that interfere with the task being done<br>[B] it is a special type of loud sound<br>[C] it is usually unavoidable in big cities<br>[D] it can be defined more precisely than the latter</p><p>16.One of the harmful effects of noise on human performance is that ________.<br>[A] it reduces one’s sensitivity<br>[B] it renders the victim helpless<br>[C] it deprives one of the enjoyment of music<br>[D] it drowns out conversations at worksites</p><p>17.The purpose of this passage is ________.<br>[A] to define the effects of noise on human behavior<br>[B] to warn people of the danger of noise pollution<br>[C] to give advice as to how to prevent hearing loss<br>[D] to tell the difference between noise and sound</p><h2 id="Text-3"><a href="#Text-3" class="headerlink" title="Text 3"></a>Text 3</h2><p>①The traditional belief that a woman’s place is in the home and that a woman ought not to go out to work can hardly be reasonably maintained in present conditions. ②It is said that it is a woman’s task to care for the children, but families today tend to be small and with a year or two between children. ③Thus a woman’s whole period of childbearing may occur within five years. ④Furthermore, with compulsory education from the age of five or six her role as chief educator of her children soon ceases. ⑤Thus, even if we agree that a woman should stay at home to look after her children before they are of school age, for many women, this period would extend only for about ten years.<br>①It might be argued that the house-proud woman would still find plenty to do about the home. ②That may be so, but it is certainly no longer necessary for a woman to spend her whole life cooking, cleaning, mending and sewing. ③Washing machines take the drudgery out of laundry, the latest models being entirely automatic and able to wash and dry a large quantity of clothes in a few minutes. ④Refrigerators have made it possible to store food for long periods and many pre-cooked foods are obtainable in tins. ⑤Shopping, instead of being a daily task, can be completed in one day a week. ⑥The new man-made fibers are more hardwiring than natural fibers and greatly reduce mending, while good ready-made clothes are cheap and plentiful.<br>①Apart from women’s own happiness, the needs of the community must be considered. ②Modern society cannot do well without the contribution that women can make in professions and other kinds of work. ③There is a serious shortage of nurses and teachers, to mention only two of the occupations followed by women. ④It is extremely wasteful to give years of training at public expense only to have the qualified teacher or nurse marry after a year or two and be lost forever to her profession. ⑤The training, it is true, will help her in duties as a mother, but if she continued to work, her service would be more widely useful. ⑥Many factories and shops, too, are largely staffed by women, many of them married. ⑦While here the question of training is not so important, industry and trade would be seriously short of staff if married women did not work.<br>18.The author holds that ________.<br>[A] the right place for all women, married or otherwise, is the home, not elsewhere<br>[B] all married women should have some occupation outside the home<br>[C] a married woman should give first priority to her duties as a mother<br>[D] it is desirable for uneducated married women to stay at home and take care of the family</p><p>19.A house-proud woman .<br>[A] would devote her whole life to her family<br>[B] would take her own happiness and that of her family as her chief concern<br>[C] would still need some special training at public expense to help her in her duties as a housewife<br>[D] would take full advantage of modern household appliances</p><p>20.According to the author, modern society .<br>[A] can operate just as well even without women participation<br>[B] has been greatly hampered in its development by the shortage of women nurses and women teachers<br>[C] cannot operate properly without the contribution of women<br>[D] will be seriously affected by the continuing shortage of working women in heavy industries and international trade</p><h1

It would be necessary to locate one that was   7   and that was big enough to provide a good supply of ice when it reached us. Engineers think that an iceberg up to seven miles long and one and a half miles wide could be transported if the tug pulling it was as big as a supertanker! Even then they would cover only twenty miles every day. However,  8   the iceberg was at its destination, more that 7,000 million cubic metres of water could be taken from it! That would probably be more than enough for any medium-sized city even in the hottest summer! But no doubt a use could be found for it.   9  , scientist say, there would not be too much wastage in such a journey. The larger the iceberg, the slower it melts, even if it is towed through the tropics. This is because when the sun has a bigger area to warm   10  , less heat actually gets into the iceberg. The vast frozen centre would be unaffected.

Why don’t they land right on the White House lawn and declare themselves?” people asked.<br>In reply, scientists say that, while this may be what we want, it may not necessarily be what they want.<br> “The most likely explanation, it seems to me,” said Dr. Mead, “is that they are simply watching what we are up to – that responsible society outside our solar system is keeping an eye on us to see that we don’t set in motion a chain reaction that might have unexpected effects for outside our solar system.”<br>Opinions from other scientists might go like this: “Why should they want to get in touch with us? We may feel we’re more important than we really are! They may want to observe us only and not interfere with the development of our civilization. They may not care if we see them but they also may not care to say ‘hello’.”<br>①Some scientists have also suggested that Earth is a kind of zoo or wildlife reserve. ②Just as we set aside wilderness

and economically, so a larger proportion of the world’s population is able to buy and use a car. ②Possessing a car gives a much greater degree of mobility, enabling the driver to move around freely. ③The owner of a car is no longer forced to rely on public transport and is, therefore, not compelled to work locally. ④He can choose from different jobs and probably changes his work more frequently as he is not restricted to a choice within a small radius. ⑤Travelling to work by car is also more comfortable than having to use public transport; the driver can adjust the heating in winter and the air conditioning in the summer to suit his own needs and preference. ⑥There is no irritation caused by waiting for trains, buses or underground trains, standing in long patient queues, or sitting on windy platforms, for as long as half an hour sometimes. ⑦With the building of good, fast motorways long distances can be covered rapidly and pleasantly. ⑧For the first time in this century also, many people are now able to enjoy their leisure time to the full by making trips to the country or seaside at the weekends, instead of being confined to their immediate neighbourhood. ⑨This feeling of independence, and the freedom to go where you please, is perhaps the greatest advantage of the car.<br>①When considering the drawbacks, perhaps pollution is of prime importance. ②As more and more cars are produced and used, so the emission from their exhaust-pipes contains an ever larger volume of poisonous gas. ③Some of the contents of this gas, such as lead, not only pollute the atmosphere but cause actual harm to the health of people. ④Many of the minor illnesses of modern industrial society, headaches, tiredness, and stomach upsets are thought to arise from breathing polluted air; doctors’ surgeries are full of people suffering from illnesses caused by pollution. ⑤It is also becoming increasingly difficult to deal with the problem of traffic in towns; most of the important cities of the world suffer from traffic congestion. ⑥In fact any advantage gained in comfort is often cancelled out in city driving by the frustration caused by traffic jams: endless queues of cars crawling one after another through all the main streets. ⑦As an increasing number of traffic regulation schemes are devised, the poor bewildered driver finds himself diverted and forced into one-way systems which cause even greater delays than the traffic jams they are supposed to prevent. ⑧The mounting cost of petrol and the increased license fees and road tax all add to the driver’s worries. ⑨In fact, he must sometimes wonder if the motor car is such a blessing and not just a menace.</p><p>14.More and more people can afford to buy and use cars because ________.<br>[A] an increasing number of cars are being produced<br>[B] the cost of cars is getting cheaper with the development of technology<br>[C] lots of countries have become more developed<br>[D] the use of cars has proved to be more economical</p><p>15.The advantages of having a car are best experienced in the driver’s ________.<br>[A] freedom in choosing his job<br>[B] comfort during the travels<br>[C] enjoyment of his leisure time<br>[D] feeling of self-reliance</p><p>16.What is considered by the writer as the greatest menace to the people caused by the widespread use of motor cars?<br>[A] air pollution<br>[B]

practically non-existent. ②It is nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her, as he ought. ③In fact, it is saddening to note that if a man does offer his seat to an older woman, it is nearly always a Continental man or one from the older generation.<br>①This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued about by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy and that those who go out to work should take their turn in the rat race like anyone else. ②Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. ③Even if it is not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for younger women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. ④Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves “First come, first served,” while a grey-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands? ⑤Yet this is all too often seen.<br>①Conditions in travel are really very hard on everyone, we know, but hardship is surely no excuse. ②Sometimes one wonders what would have been the behaviour of these stout young men in a packed refugee train or a train on its way to a prison-camp during the War. ③Would they have considered it only right and their proper due to keep the best places for themselves then?<br>①Older people, tired and irritable from a day’s work, are not angels, either — far from it. ②Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. ③One cannot commend this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse.<br>①If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems imperative, not only that communications in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. ②All over cities, it seems that people are too tired and too rushed to be polite. ③Shop assistants won’t bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductor pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on and so on. ④It seems to us that it is up to the young and strong to do their small part to stop such deterioration.</p><p>17.From what you have read, would you expect manners

Chinese. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)</p><p>When Jane Matheson started work at Advanced Electronics Inc. 12 years ago, (21) she laboured over a microscope, hand-welding tiny electronic computers and turned out 18 per hour. Now she tends the computerized machinery that turns out high capacity memory chips at the rate of 2,600 per hour. Production is up, profits are up, her income is up and Mrs. Matheson says the work is far less strain on her eyes.<br>But the most significant effect of the changes at AEI was felt by the workers who are no longer there. Before the new computerized equipment was introduced, there were 940 workers at the plant. Now there are 121. (22) A plant follow-up survey showed that one year after the layoffs only 38% of the released workers found new employment at the same or better wages. Nearly half finally settled for lower pay and more than 13% are still out of work. The AEI example is only one of hundreds around the country which forge intelligently ahead into the latest technology, but leave the majority of their workers behind.<br>(23) Its beginnings obscured by unemployment caused by the world economic slow-down, the new technological unemployment may emerge as the great socio-economic challenge of the end of the 20th century. One corporation economist says the growth of “machine job replacement” has been with us since the beginning of the industrial revolution, but never at the pace it is now. The human costs will be astonishing. (24) “It’s humiliating to be done out of your job by a machine and there is no way to fight back, but it is the effort to find a new job that really hurts.” Some workers, like Jane Matheson, are retrained to handle the new equipment, but often a whole new set of skills is required and that means a new, and invariably smaller set of workers. (25) The old workers, trapped by their limited skills, often never regain their old status and employment. Many drift into marginal areas. They feel no pride in their new work. They get badly paid for it and they feel miserable, but still they are luckier than those who never find it.<br>(26) The social costs go far beyond the welfare and unemployment payments made by the government. Unemployment increases the chances of divorce, child abuse, and alcoholism, a new federal survey shows. Some experts say the problem is only temporary… that new technology will eventually create as many jobs as it destroys. (27) But futurologist Hymen Seymour says the astonishing efficiency of the new technology means there will be a simple and direct net reduction in the amount of human labor that needs to be done. “We should treat this as an opportunity to give people more leisure. It may not be easy, but society will have to reach a new unanimity on the division and distribution of labor,” Seymour says. He predicts most people will work only six-hour days and four-day weeks by the end of the century. But the concern of the unemployed is for now. (28) Federally funded training and free back-to-school programs for laid-off workers are under way, but few experts believe they will be able to keep up with the pace of the new technology. For the next few years, for a substantial portion of the workforce, times are going to be very tough indeed.</p>]]></content>

now on her 15-month and one-billion-kilometer flight to Venus. ②A new phase in space exploration has begun.<br>①The planet Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth; it is the only other object in the solar system, in fact, that even comes close to earth’s size. ②Venus has a similar density, so it is probably made of approximately the same stuff, and it has an atmosphere, complete with clouds. ③It is also the closest planet to earth, and thus the most similar in distance from the sun. ④In short, Venus seems to justify its long-held nickname of “earth’s twin.”<br>①The surface temperature of Venus reaches some 900F. ②Added to that is an atmospheric pressure about 90 times Earth’s: High overhead in the carbon dioxide (CO2) that passes for air is a layer of clouds, perhaps 10 to 20 miles thick, whose little drops consist mostly of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). ③Water is all but nonexistent.<br>①Born with so many fundamental similarities to earth, how did Venus get to be so radically different: It is not just an academic matter. ②For all its extremes, Venus is a valuable laboratory for researchers studying the weather and climate of earth. ③It has no earth’s oceans, so the heat transport and other mechanisms are greatly simplified. ④In addition, the planet Venus takes 243 earth-days to turn once on its axis, so incoming heat from the sun is added and distributed at a more leisurely, observable pace.</p><p>11.Venus is similar to Earth in ________.<br>[A] size and density<br>[B] distance from the sun<br>[C] having atmosphere<br>[D] all of the above</p><p>12.The greatest

political leaders and some of its male union chiefs are said to have been even more puzzled to see that the tractor was followed by about 200,000 women in a parading procession that took more than three hours to snake through central Rome.<br>①Shouting slogans, waving flags and dancing to drumbeats, the women had come to the capital from all over Italy to demonstrate for “a job for each of us, a different type of job, and a society without violence.” ②So far, action to improve women’s opportunities in employment has been the province of collective industrial bargaining. ③“But there is a growing awareness that this is not enough,” says a researcher on female labor at the government-funded Institute for the Development of Professional Training for Workers.<br>①Women, who constitute 52 per cent of Italy’s population, today represent only 35 per cent of Italy’s total workforce and 33 per cent of the total number of Italians with jobs. ②However, their presence in the workplace is growing. ③The employment of women is expanding considerably in services, next to the public administration and commerce as their principal workplace. ④Official statistics also show that women have also made significant strides in self-employment. ⑤More and more women are going into business for themselves. ⑥Many young women are turning to business because of the growing overall in employment. ⑦It is also a fact that today many prejudices have disappeared, so that banks and other financial institutes make judgments on purely business considerations without caring if it is a man or a woman.<br>①Such changes are occurring in the professions too. ②The number of women doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers and university professors increased two to three fold. ③Some of the changes are immediately visible. ④For example, women have appeared on the scene for the first time as state police, railway workers and street cleaners.<br>①However, the present situation is far from satisfactory

to bright kids is that they are very likely to grow into bright adults.<br>To find this out, l, 500 gifted persons were followed up to their thirty-fifth year with these results:<br>①On adult intelligence tests, they scored as high as they had as children. ②They were, as a group, in good health, physically and mentally. ③84 per cent of their group were married and seemed content with their lives.<br>①About 70 per cent had graduated from college, though only 30 per cent had graduated with honors. ②A few had even dropped out, but nearly half of these had returned to graduate. ③Of the men, 80 per cent were in one of the professions or in business management or semiprofessional jobs. ④The women who had remained single had office, business, or professional occupations.<br>The group had published 90 books and 1,500 articles in scientific, scholarly, and literary magazines and had collected more than 100 patents.<br>①In a material way they did not do badly either. ②Average income was considerably higher among the gifted people, especially the men, than for the country as a whole, despite their comparative youth.<br>In fact, far from being strange, most of the gifted were turning their early promise into practical reality.</p><p>18.The old idea that talented children “burn themselves out” in the early years is ________.<br>[A] true in all senses<br>[B] refuted by the

Translation</h1><p>Read the following passage carefully and then translate the sentences underlined into Chinese. (20 points)<br>People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behaviors are formed. It is not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is competitive.<br>Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these types of questions. (21) They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behaviors. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other. The controversy is often conveniently referred to as “nature vs. nurture.”<br>(22) Those who support the “nature” side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological factors. (23) That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is central to this theory.<br>Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is pre-determined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts.<br>Those who support the “nurture” theory, that is, they advocate education, are often called behaviorists. They claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, sees humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. (24) The behaviorists maintain that, like machines, humans respond to environmental stimuli as the basis of their behavior.<br>Let us examine the different explanations about one human characteristic, intelligence, offered by the two theories. (25) Supporters of the “nature” theory insist that we are born with a certain capacity for learning that is biologically determined. Needless to say: They don’t believe that factors in the environment have much influence on what is basically a predetermined characteristic. On the other hand, behaviorists argue that our intelligence levels are the product of our experiences. (26) Behaviorists suggest that the child who is raised in an environment where there are many stimuli which develop his or her capacity for appropriate responses will experience greater intellectual development.<br>The social and political implications of these two theories are profound. (27) In the United States, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligence tests. This leads some “nature” proponents to conclude that blacks are biologically inferior to whites. (28) Behaviorists, in contrast, say that differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often deprived of many of the educational and other environmental advantages that whites enjoy.<br>Most people think neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior.</p>]]></content>

Some of the difficulties they experienced when they were trying to <em><strong>1</strong></em> themselves to the new medium were technical. When working <em><strong>2</strong></em>_ radio, for example, they had become <em><strong>3</strong></em> to seeing on behalf of the listener.<br>This <em><strong>4</strong></em> of seeing for others means that the commentator has to be very good at talking. <em><strong>5</strong></em> all, he has to be able to <em><strong>6</strong></em> a continuous sequence of visual images which <em><strong>7</strong></em> meaning to the sounds which the listener hears. In the <em><strong>8</strong></em> of television, however, the commentator sees everything with the viewer. His role, therefore, is <em><strong>9</strong></em> different. He is there to make <em><strong>10</strong></em> that the viewer does not miss some point of interest, to help him <em><strong>11</strong></em> on particular things, and to <em><strong>12</strong></em> the images on the television screen. <em><strong>13</strong></em> his radio colleague, he must know the <em><strong>14</strong></em> of silence and how to use it at those moments <em><strong>15</strong></em> the pictures speak for themselves.</p><p>1.［A］ turn   ［B］ adapt        ［C］ alter          ［D］ modify<br>2.［A］ on     ［B］ at           ［C］ with          ［D］ behind<br>3.［A］ experienced ［B］ determined   ［C］ established    ［D］ accustomed<br>4.［A］ efficiency   ［B］ technology   ［C］ art        ［D］ performance<br>5.［A］ Of        ［B］ For         ［C］Above      ［D］ In<br>6.［A］ inspire     ［B］ create      ［C］ cause     ［D］ perceive<br>7.［A］ add        ［B］ apply        [C] affect      ［D]reflect<br>8.［A］ occasion  ［B］ event       ［C］ fact       ［D］ case<br>9.［A］ equally     ［B］ completely  ［C］ initially    ［D］ hardly<br>10.［A］ definite    ［B］ possible    ［C］ sure       ［D］ clear<br>11.[A］ focus      ［B］ attend      ［C］ follow   ［D］ insist<br>12.［A］ exhibit    ［B］ demonstrate  ［C］ expose      ［D］ interpret<br>13.［A］ Like     ［B］ Unlike      ［C］ As         ［D］ For<br>14.［A］ purpose    ［B］ goal         ［C］ value      ［D］ intention<br>15.［A］ if         ［B］ when       ［C］ which      ［D］ as</p><h1 id="Section-ⅡReading-Comprehension"><a href="#Section-ⅡReading-Comprehension" class="headerlink" title="Section ⅡReading Comprehension"></a>Section ⅡReading Comprehension</h1><h2 id="Part-A"><a href="#Part-A" class="headerlink" title="Part A"></a>Part A</h2><p>Directions:</p><p>Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each question four answers are given.Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET.(30 points)</p><h3 id="Passage-1"><a href="#Passage-1" class="headerlink" title="Passage 1"></a>Passage 1</h3><p>A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people.<br>Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability.<br>Accountability isn’t hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences.<br>Of the many values that hold civilization together—honesty, kindness, and so on—accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law—and, ultimately, no society.<br>My job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people’s behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment.<br>Fortunately there are still communities—smaller towns, usually—where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that proclaim: “In this family certain things are not tolerated—they simply are not done! ”<br>Yet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you enrage him.<br>The main cause of this break-down is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it’s the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged upbringing, by the school that didn’t teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn’t provide a stable home.<br>I don’t believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything.<br>We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it.</p><p>16.What the wise man said suggests that_____.<br>[A] it’s unnecessary for good people to do anything in face of evil<br>[B] it’s certain that evil will prevail if good men do nothing about it<br>[C] it’s only natural for virtue to defeat evil<br>[D] it’s desirable for good men to keep away from evil</p><p>17.According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime,_____________.<br>[A] society is to be held responsible<br>[B] modern civilization is responsible for it<br>[C] the criminal himself should bear the blame<br>[D] the standards of living should be improved</p><p>18.Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have________.<br>[A] less self-discipline<br>[B] better sense of discipline<br>[C] more mutual respect<br>[D] less effective government</p><p>19.The writer is sorry to have noticed that_______.</p><p>[A］people in large cities tend to excuse criminals<br>[B] people in small towns still stick to old discipline and standards<br>[C] today’s society lacks sympathy for people in difficulty<br>[D] people in disadvantaged circumstances are engaged in criminal activities</p><p>20.The key point of the passage is that______.<br>[A] stricter discipline should be maintained in schools and families<br>[B] more good examples should be set for people to follow<br>[C] more restrictions should be imposed on people’s behavior<br>[D] more people should accept the value of accountability</p><h3 id="Passage-2"><a href="#Passage-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 2"></a>Passage 2</h3><p>The period of adolescence, i. e., the period between childhood and adulthood, may be long or short, depending on social expectations and on society’s definition as to what constitutes maturity and adulthood. In primitive societies adolescence is frequently a relatively short period of time, while in industrial societies with patterns of prolonged education coupled with laws against child labor, the period of adolescence is much longer and may include most of the second decade of one’s life. Furthermore, the length of the adolescent period and the definition of adulthood status may change in a given society as social and economic conditions change. Examples of this type of change are the disappearance of the frontier in the latter part of the nineteenth century in the United States, and more universally, the industrialization of an agricultural society.<br>In modern society, ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition and symbolic significance and there no longer is agreement as to what constitutes initiation ceremonies. Social ones have been replaced by a sequence of steps that lead to increased recognition and social status. For example, grade school graduation, high school graduation and college graduation constitute such a sequence, and while each step implies certain behavioral changes and social recognition, the significance of each depends on the socio-economic status and the educational ambition of the individual. Ceremonies for adolescence have also been replaced by legal definitions of status roles, right, privileges and responsibilities. It is during the nine years from the twelfth birthday to the twenty-first that the protective and restrictive aspects of childhood and minor status are removed and adult privileges and responsibilities are granted. The twelve-year-old is no longer considered a child and has to pay full fare for train, airplane, theater and movie tickets. Basically, the individual at this age loses childhood privileges without gaining significant adult rights. At the age of sixteen the adolescent is granted certain adult rights which increase his social status by providing him with more freedom and choices. He now can obtain a driver’s license; he can leave public schools; and he can work without the restrictions of child labor laws. At the age of eighteen the law provides adult responsibilities as well as rights; the young man can now be a soldier, but he also can marry without parental permission. At the age of twenty-one the individual obtains his full legal rights as an adult. He now can vote, he can buy liquor, he can enter into financial contracts, and he is entitled to run for public office. No additional basic rights are acquired as a function of age after majority status has been attained. None of these legal provisions determine at what point adulthood has been reached but they do point to the prolonged period of adolescence.</p><p>21.The period of adolescence is much longer in industrial societies because_______.<br>[A] the definition of maturity has changed<br>[B] the industrialized society is more developed<br>[C] more education is provided and laws against child labor are made<br>[D] ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition and symbolic significance</p><p>22.Former social ceremonies that used to mark adolescence have given place to_________.<br>[A] graduations from schools and colleges<br>[B] social recognition<br>[C] socio-economic status<br>[D] certain behavioral changes</p><p>23.No one can expect to fully enjoy the adulthood privileges until he is_______. <br>[A] eleven years old<br>[B] sixteen years old <br>[C] twenty-one years old<br>[D] between twelve and twenty-one years old</p><p>24.Starting from 22, _______.<br>[A] one will obtain more basic rights<br>[B] the older one becomes, the more basic rights he will have<br>[C] one won’t get more basic rights than when he is 21<br>[D] one will enjoy more rights granted by society</p><p>25.According to the passage, it is true that___.<br>[A] in the late 19th century in the United States the dividing line between adolescence and adulthood no longer existed<br>[B] no one can marry without the permission of his parents until the age of twenty-one<br>[C] one is considered to have reached adulthood when he has a driver’s license<br>[D] one is not free from the restrictions of child labor laws until he can join the army</p><h3 id="Passage-3"><a href="#Passage-3" class="headerlink" title="Passage 3"></a>Passage 3</h3><p>　　  Most growing plants contain much more water than all other materials combined. C. R. Barnes has suggested that it is as proper to term the plant a water structure as to call a house composed mainly of brick a brick building. Certain it is that all essential processes of plant growth and development occur in water. The mineral elements from the soil that are usable by the plant must be dissolved in the soil solution before they can be taken into the root. They are carried to all parts of the growing plant and are built into essential plant materials while in a dissolved state. The carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air may enter the leaf as a gas but is dissolved in water in the leaf before it is combined with a part of the water to form simple sugars—the base material from which the plant body is mainly built. Actively growing plant parts are generally 75 to 90 percent water. Structural parts of plants, such as woody stems no longer actively growing, may have much less water than growing tissues.<br>　　  The actual amount of water in the plant at any one time, however, is only a very small part of what passes through it during its development. The processes of photosynthesis, by which carbon dioxide and water are combined—in the presence of chlorophyll (叶绿素) and with energy derived from light—to form sugars, require that carbon dioxide from the air enter the plant. This occurs mainly in the leaves. The leaf surface is not solid but contains great numbers of minute openings, through which the carbon dioxide enters. The same structure that permits the one gas to enter the leaf, however, permits another gas—water vapor—to be lost from it. Since carbon dioxide is present in the air only in trace quantities (3 to 4 parts in 10,000 parts of air) and water vapor is near saturation in the air spaces within the leaf (at 80℉, saturated air would contain about 186 parts of water vapor in 10, 000 parts of air), the total amount of water vapor lost is many times the carbon dioxide intake. Actually, because of wind and other factors, the loss of water in proportion to carbon dioxide intake may be even greater than the relative concentrations of the two gases. Also, not all of the carbon dioxide that enters the leaf is synthesized into carbohydrates (碳水化合物) .</p><p>26.A growing plant needs water for all of the following except_________.<br>[A] forming sugars<br>[B] sustaining woody stems<br>[C] keeping green<br>[D] producing carbon dioxide</p><p>27.The essential function of photosynthesis in terms of plant needs is______.<br>[A] to form sugars<br>[B] to derive energy from light<br>[C] to preserve water<br>[D] to combine carbon dioxide with water</p><p>28.The second paragraph uses facts to develop the essential idea that________.<br>[A] a plant efficiently utilizes most of the water it absorbs<br>[B] carbon dioxide is the essential substance needed for plant development<br>[C] a plant needs more water than is found in its composition<br>[D] the stronger the wind, the more the water vapor loss</p><p>29.According to the passage, which of the following statements is true?<br>[A]The mineral elements will not be absorbed by the plant unless they are dissolved in its root.<br>[B] The woody stems contain more water than the leaves.<br>[C] Air existing around the leaf is found to be saturated.<br>[D] Only part of the carbon dioxide in the plant is synthesized.</p><p>30.This passage is mainly about________.<br>[A] the functions of carbon dioxide and water<br>[B] the role of water in a growing plant<br>[C] the process of simple sugar formation<br>[D] the synthesis of water with carbon dioxide</p><h2 id="Part-B"><a href="#Part-B" class="headerlink" title="Part B"></a>Part B</h2><p>Directions: Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points)</p><p>The fact is that the energy crisis, which has suddenly been officially announced, has been with us for a long time now, and will be with us for an even longer time. Whether Arab oil flows freely or not, it is clear to everyone that world industry cannot be allowed to depend on so fragile a base. (31) The supply of oil can be shut off unexpectedly at any time, and in any case, the oil wells will all run dry in thirty years or so at the present rate of use.<br>(32) New sources of energy must be found, and this will take time, but it is not likely to result in any situation that will ever restore that sense of cheap and plentiful energy we have had in the times past. For an indefinite period from here on, mankind is going to advance cautiously, and consider itself lucky that it can advance at all.<br>To make the situation worse, there is as yet no sign that any slowing of the world’s population is in sight. Although the birth-rate has dropped in some nations, including the United States, the population of the world seems sure to pass six billion and perhaps even seven billion as the twenty-first century opens.<br>(33) The food supply will not increase nearly enough to match this, which means that we are heading into a crisis in the matter of producing and marketing food.<br>Taking all this into account, what might we reasonably estimate supermarkets to be like in the year 2001?<br>To begin with, the world food supply is going to become steadily tighter over the next thirty years—even here in the United States. By 2001, the population of the United States will be at least two hundred fifty million and possibly two hundred seventy million, and the nation will find it difficult to expand food production to fill the additional mouths. (34) This will be particularly true since energy pinch will make it difficult to continue agriculture in the high-energy American fashion that makes it possible to combine few farmers with high yields.<br>It seems almost certain that by 200l the United States will no longer be a great foodexporting nation and that, if necessity forces exports, it will be at the price of belt-tightening at home.<br>In fact, as food items will tend to decline in quality and decrease in variety, there is very likely to be increasing use of flavouring additives. (35) Until such time as mankind has the sense to lower its population to the point where the planet can provide a comfortable support for all, people will have to accept more “unnatural food”.</p><h1 id="Section-Ⅲ-Writing-15points"><a href="#Section-Ⅲ-Writing-15points" class="headerlink" title="Section Ⅲ Writing(15points)"></a>Section Ⅲ Writing(15points)</h1><p>Directions:<br>A) Title: WHERE TO LIVE—IN THE CITY OR THE COUNTRY?<br>B) Time limit: 40 minutes<br>C) Word limit: 120 -150 words (not including the given opening sentence)<br>D) Your composition should be based on the OUTLINE below and should start with the given opening sentence.<br>E) Your composition must be written clearly in the ANSWER SHEET.<br>OUTLINE:<br>1.Conveniences of the city<br>2.Attractions of the country<br>3.Disadvantages of both<br>4.My preference</p>]]></content>

Everybody knows that the nicest men become monsters behind the wheel. It is all very well, again, to have a tiger in the tank, but to have one in the driver’s seat is another matter altogether. You might tolerate the odd road-hog, the rude and inconsiderate driver, but nowadays the well-mannered motorist is the exception to the rule. (Perhaps the situation calls for a “Be Kind to Other Drivers” campaign, otherwise it may get completely out of hand.)<br>Road politeness is not only good manners, but good sense too. It takes the most cool-headed and good-tempered of drivers to resist the temptation to revenge when subjected to uncivilized behavior. On the other hand, a little politeness goes a long way towards relieving the tensions of motoring. A friendly nod or a wave of acknowledgment in response to an act of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of goodwill and tolerance so necessary in modern traffic conditions. But such acknowledgments of politeness are all too rare today. Many drivers nowadays don’t even seem able to recognize politeness when they see it.<br>However, misplaced politeness can also be dangerous. Typical examples are the driver who brakes violently to allow a car to emerge from a side street at some hazard to following traffic, when a few seconds later the road would be clear anyway; or the man who waves a child across a zebra crossing into the path of oncoming vehicles that may be unable to stop in time. The same goes for encouraging old ladies to cross the road wherever and whenever they care to. It always amazes me that the highways are not covered with the dead bodies of these grannies.<br>A veteran driver, whose manners are faultless, told me it would help if motorists learnt to filter correctly into traffic streams one at a time without causing the total blockages that give rise to bad temper. Unfortunately, modern motorists can’t even learn to drive, let alone master the subtler aspects of roadsmanship. Years ago the experts warned us that the car ownership explosion would demand a lot more give-and-take from all road users. It is high time for all of us to take this message to heart.</p><p>16.According to this passage, troubles on the road are primarily caused by________.<br>[A] people’s attitude towards the road-hog<br>[B] the rhythm of modern life<br>[C] the behavior of the driver<br>[D] traffic conditions</p><p>17.The sentence “You might tolerate the odd road-hog…the rule.”(Para.1) implies that___.<br>[A] our society is unjust towards well-mannered motorists<br>[B] rude drivers can be met only occasionally<br>[C] the well-mannered motorist cannot tolerate the road-hog<br>[D] nowadays impolite drivers constitute the majority of motorists</p><p>18.By “good sense”, the writer means_____.<br>[A] the driver’s ability to understand and react reasonably<br>[B] the driver’s prompt response to difficult and severe conditions<br>[C] the driver’s tolerance of rude or even savage behavior<br>[D] the driver’s acknowledgment of politeness and regulations</p><p>19.Experts have long pointed out that in the face of car-ownership explosion, __________.<br>[A] road users should make more sacrifice<br>[B] drivers should be ready to yield to each other<br>[C]drivers should have more communication among themselves<br>[D]drivers will suffer great loss if they pay no respect to others</p><p>20.In the writer’s opinion, ___________.<br>[A]strict traffic regulations are badly needed<br>[B]drivers should apply road politeness properly<br>[C] rude drivers should be punished<br>[D] drivers should avoid traffic jams</p><h3 id="Passage-2"><a href="#Passage-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 2"></a>Passage 2</h3><p>In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror—the glass in the roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun’s rays to enter but prevents the heat from escaping.<br>According to a weather expert’s prediction, the atmosphere will be 3°C warmer in the year 2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present rate. If this warming up took place, the ice caps in the poles would begin to melt, thus raising sea level several metres and severely flooding coastal cities. Also, the increase in atmospheric temperature would lead to great changes in the climate of the northern hemisphere, possibly resulting in an alteration of the earth’s chief food-growing zones.<br>In the past, concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet. But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic, which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming: in other words, by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels.<br>Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing. The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place. This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth.<br>However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere, where temperatures seem to be falling. Scientists conclude, therefore, that up to now natural influences on the weather have exceeded those caused by man. The question is: Which natural cause has most effect on the weather?<br>One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun. Astronomers at one research station have studied the hot spots and “cold” spots (that is, the relatively less hot spots) on the sun. As the sun rotates, every 27.5 days, it presents hotter or “colder” faces to the earth, and different aspects to different parts of the earth. This seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution of the earth’s atmospheric pressure, and consequently on wind circulation. The sun is also variable over a long term: its heat output goes up and down in cycles, the latest trend being downward.<br>Scientists are now finding mutual relations between models of solar-weather interactions and the actual climate over many thousands of years, including the last Ice Age. The problem is that the models are predicting that the world should be entering a new Ice Age and it is not. One way of solving this theoretical difficulty is to assume a delay of thousands of years while the solar effects overcome the inertia(惯性)of the earth’s climate. If this is right, the warming effect of carbon dioxide might thus be serving as a useful counte-balance to the sun’s diminishing heat.</p><p>21.It can be concluded that a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would_____.<br>[A] prevent the sun’s rays from reaching the earth’s surface<br>[B] mean a warming up in the Arctic<br>[C] account for great changes in the climate in the northern hemisphere<br>[D] raise the temperature of the earth’s surface</p><p>22.The article was written to explain________.<br>[A] the greenhouse effect<br>[B] the solar effects on the earth<br>[C] the models of solar-weather interactions<br>[D] the causes affecting weather</p><p>23.Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northern hemisphere, temperatures there seem to be falling.

Others say that the opposite is true: that international contests encourage false national pride and lead to misunderstanding and hatred. There is probably some truth in both arguments, but in recent years the Olympic Games have done little to support the view that sports encourages international brotherhood. Not only was there the tragic incident involving the murder of athletes, but the Games were also ruined by lesser incidents caused principally by minor national contests.<br>One country received its second-place medals with visible indignation after the hockey(曲棍球)final. There had been noisy scenes at the end of the hockey match, the losers objecting to the final decisions. They were convinced that one of their goals should not have been disallowed and that their opponents’victory was unfair. Their manager was in a rage when he said:“This wasn’t hockey. Hockey and the International Hockey Federation are finished.” The president of the Federation said later that such behavior could result in the suspension of the team for at least three years.<br>The American basketball team announced that they would not yield first place to Russia, after a disputable end to their contest. The game had ended in disturbance. It was thought at first that the United States had won, by a single point, but it was announced that there were three seconds still to play. A Russian player then threw the ball from one end of the court to the other, and another player popped it into the basket. It was the first time the USA had ever lost an Olympic basketball match. An appeal jury debated the matter for four and a half hours before announcing that the result would stand. The American players then voted not to receive the silver medals.<br>Incidents of this kind will continue as long as sport is played competitively rather than for the love of the game. The suggestion that athletes should compete as individuals or in non-national teams might be too much to hope for. But in the present organization of the Olympics there is far too much that encourages aggressive patriotism.</p><p>26.According to the author, recent Olympic Games have _______.<br>[A] created goodwill between the nations<br>[B] bred only false national pride<br>[C] barely showed any international friendship<br>[D] led to more and more misunderstanding and hatred</p><p>27.What did the manager mean by saying, “…Hockey and the International Hockey Federation are finished”?<br>[A] His team would no longer take part in international games.<br>[B]Hockey and the Federation are both ruined by the unfair decisions.<br>[C]There should be no more hockey matches organized by the Federation.<br>[D] The Federation should be dissolved.</p><p>28.The basketball example implied that______.<br>[A] too much patriotism was displayed in the incident<br>[B] the announcement to prolong the match was wrong<br>[C] the appeal jury was too hesitant in making the decision<br>[D] the American team was right in rejecting the silver medals</p><p>29.The author gives the two examples in paragraphs 2 and 3 to show____________.<br>[A] how false national pride led to undesirable incidents in international games<br>[B] that sportsmen have been more obedient than they used to be<br>[C] that competitiveness in the games discourages international friendship<br>[D] that unfair decisions are common in Olympic Games</p><p>30.What conclusion can be drawn from the passage?<br>[A]The organization of the Olympic Games must be improved.<br>[B]Athletes should compete as individuals in the Olympic Games.<br>[C] Sport should be played competitively rather than for the love of the game.<br>[D]International contests are liable for misunderstanding between nations.</p><h2 id="Part-B"><a href="#Part-B" class="headerlink" title="Part B"></a>Part B</h2><p>Directions:<br>Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese.(15 points)</p><p>“Intelligence” at best is an assumptive construct—the meaning of the word has never been clear. 31) There is more agreement on the kinds of behavior referred to by the term than there is on how to interpret or classify them. But it is generally agreed that a person of high intelligence is one who can grasp ideas readily, make distinctions, reason logically, and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems. An intelligence test is a rough measure of a child’s capacity for learning, particularly for learning the kinds of things required in school. It does not measure character, social adjustment, physical endurance, manual skills, or artistic abilities. It is not supposed to—it was not designed for such purposes. 32) To criticize it for such failure is roughly comparable to criticizing a thermometer for not measuring wind velocity.<br>The other thing we have to notice is that the assessment of the intelligence of any subject is essentially a comparative affair.<br>33.Now since the assessment of intelligence is a comparative matter we must be sure that the scale with which we are comparing our subjects provides a “valid” or “fair” comparison. It is here that some of the difficulties which interest us begin. Any test performed involves at least three factors: the intention to do one’s best, the knowledge required for understanding what you have to do, and the intellectual ability to do it. 34) The first two must be equal for all who are being compared, if any comparison in terms of intelligence is to be made. In school populations in our culture these assumptions can be made fair and reasonable, and the value of intelligence testing has been proved thoroughly. Its value lies, of course, in its providing a satisfactory basis for prediction. No one is in the least interested in the marks a little child gets on his test; What we are interested in is whether we can conclude from his mark on the test that the child will do better or worse than other children of his age at tasks which we think require “general intelligence”. 35) On the whole such a conclusion can be drawn with a certain degree of confidence, but only if the child can be assumed to have had the same attitude towards the test as the other with whom he is being compared, and only if he was not punished by lack of relevant information which they possessed.</p><h1 id="Section-Ⅲ-Writing-15points"><a href="#Section-Ⅲ-Writing-15points" class="headerlink" title="Section Ⅲ Writing(15points)"></a>Section Ⅲ Writing(15points)</h1><p>Directions:<br>ATitle: FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD<br>BTime limit:40 minutes<br>CWord limit:120-150 words (not including the given opening sentence)<br>DYour composition should be based on the OUTLINE below and should start with the given opening sentence.<br>EYour composition must be written clearly on the ANSWER SHEET.<br>OUTLINE:<br>1Present situation: Lack of communication between parent and child<br>2Possible reasons:</p><ol><li>Different likes and dislikes； 2)Misunderstanding；3)Others<br>3Suggestions<br>1)For parents；2) For children</li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Section ⅠUse of English</p><p>Although interior design has existed since the beginning of architecture, its development into a specialized field is really quite recent. Interior designers have become important partly because of the many functions that might be ___1___in a single large building.<br>The importance of interior design becomes   2   when we realize how much time we   _<em>3</em>  surrounded by four walls. Whenever we need to be indoors, we want our surroundings to be _ 4   attractive and comfortable as possible. We also expect   5   place to be appropriate to its use. You would be   6   if the inside of your bedroom were suddenly changed to look   7   the inside of a restaurant. And you wouldn’t feel   8   in a business office that has the appearance of a school.<br>It soon becomes clear that the interior designer’s most important basic   9   is the function of the particular   10  . For example, a theater with poor sight lines, poor sound-shaping qualities, and   11   few entries and exits will not work for   12   purpose, no matter how beautifully it might be   13  . Nevertheless, for any kind of space, the designer has to make many of the same kind of   14 _. He or she must coordinate the shapes, lighting and decoration of everything from ceiling to floor.   15 _addition, the designer must usually select furniture or design built-in furniture, according to the functions that need to be served<br>1.[A] consisted [B] contained [C] composed [D] comprised<br>2.[A] obscure [B] attractive [C] appropriate [D] evident<br>3.[A] spend [B] require [C] settle [D] retain<br>4.[A] so [B] as [C] thus [D] such<br>5.[A] some [B] any [C] this [D] each<br>6.[A] amused [B] interested [C] shocked [D] frightened<br>7.[A] like [B] for [C] at[D] into<br>8.[A] correct [B] proper [C] right [D] suitable<br>9.[A] care [B] concern [C] attention [D] intention<br>10.[A] circumstance [B] environment [C] surroundings [D] space<br>11.[A] too [B] quite [C] a[D] far<br>12.[A] their [B] its [C] those[D] that<br>13.[A] painted [B] covered [C] ornamented [D] decorated<br>14.[A] solutions [B] conclusions [C] decisions [D] determinations<br>15.[A] For[B] In [C] As [D] with</p><p>Section ⅡReading Comprehension</p><p>Passage 1</p><p>Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the drastic experiment of FrederickⅠin the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.<br>All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.<br>Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.<br>Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months he can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to fifty words. At three he knows about l, 000 words which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.<br>Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man’s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern “toy-bear”. And even more incredible is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.<br>But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child , where the mother recognizes the signals in the child’ s babbling ( 咿呀学语) , grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child’s non-verbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language.<br>16.The purpose of Frederick Ⅰ’s experiment was__<br>[A] to prove that children are born with the ability to speak<br>[B] to discover what language a child would speak without hearing any human speech<br>[C] to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a child to speak<br>[D] to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language<br>17.The reason some children are backward in speaking is most probably that__<br>[A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly<br>[B] they are exposed to too much language at once<br>[C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak<br>[D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them<br>18.What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that<br>[A] he is born with the capacity to speak<br>[B] he has a brain more complex than an animal’s<br>[C] he can produce his own sentences<br>[D] he owes his speech ability to good nursing<br>19.Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage?<br>[A] The faculty of speech is inborn in man.<br>[B] Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language learning.<br>[C] The child’ s brain is highly selective.<br>[D] Most children learn their language in definite stages.<br>20.If a child starts to speak later than others, he will<br>[A] have a high IQ[B] be less intelligent<br>[C] be insensitive to verbal signals[D] not necessarily be backward</p><p>Passage 2</p><p>In general , our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic ( 官僚主义的)management in which man becomes a small, well-oiled cog in the machinery. The oiling is done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by psychologists and “human-relations” experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become powerless, that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is bored with it. In fact, the blue-and the white-collar workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of automated machines and bureaucratic management.<br>The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of a job; they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life. They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of human existence as emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human beings.<br>Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty than those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even more a matter of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are tested for intelligence as well as for the tight mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that moment on they are tested again and again by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge their behavior, sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as good as or better than one’s fellow competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes of unhappiness and illness.<br>Am I suggesting that we should return to the pre-industrial mode of production or to nineteenth-century “free enterprise” capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by returning to a stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our social system from a bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development of his potentialities—those of love and of reason—are the aims of all social arrangements. Production and consumption should serve only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man.<br>21.By “a well-oiled cog in the machinery” the author intends to render the idea that man is<br>[A] a necessary part of the society though each individual’s function is negligible<br>[B] working in complete harmony with the rest of the society<br>[C] an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, though functioning smoothly<br>[D] a humble component of the society, especially when working smoothly<br>22.The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees is that<br>[A] they are likely to lose their jobs<br>[B] they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life<br>[C] they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence<br>[D] they are deprived of their individuality and independence<br>23.From the passage we can infer that real happiness of life belongs to those<br>[A] who are at the bottom of the society<br>[B] who are higher up in their social status<br>[C] who prove better than their fellow-competitors<br>[D] who could keep far away from this competitive world<br>24.To solve the present social problems the author suggests that we should<br>[A] resort to the production mode of our ancestors<br>[B] offer higher wages to the workers and employees<br>[C] enable man to fully develop his potentialities<br>[D] take the fundamental realities for granted<br>25.The author’s attitude towards industrialism might best be summarized as one of __<br>[A] approval [B] dissatisfaction[C] suspicion [D] tolerance</p><p>Passage 3</p><p>When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: he can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.<br>A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by which the inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to the public after that period terminates.<br>Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a patent extended to alter this normal process of events.<br>The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’s normal life there was no color TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention.<br>Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the library attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one sure way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’s right is to plagiarize a dead patent. Likewise, because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further patents on that idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.<br>Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most “new ideas” are, in fact, as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The basic patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear.<br>26.The passage is mainly about<br>[A] an approach to patents [B] the application for patents<br>[C] the use of patents[D] the access to patents<br>27.Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?<br>[A] When a patent becomes out of effect, it can be re-patented or extended if necessary.<br>[B] It is necessary for an inventor to apply for a patent before he makes his invention publc.<br>[C] A patent holder must publicize the details of his invention when its legal period is over.<br>[D] One can get all the details of a patented invention from a library attached to the patent office.<br>28.George Valensi’s patent lasted until 1971 because<br>[A] nobody would offer any reward for his patent prior to that time<br>[B] his patent could not be put to use for an unusually long time<br>[C] there were not enough TV stations to provide color programmes<br>[D] the color TV receiver was not available until that time<br>29.The word “plagiarize”(line 8 , Para. 5) most probably means “_”.<br>[A] steal and use [B] give reward to<br>[C] make public [D] take and change<br>30.From the passage we learn that<br>[A] an invention will not benefit the inventor unless it is reduced to commercial practice<br>[B] products are actually inventions which were made a long time ago<br>[C] it is much cheaper to buy an old patent than a new one<br>[D] patent experts often recommend patents to others by conducting a search through dead patents<br>Part Ⅲ English-Chinese Translation</p><p>(31) The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind; it is simply the mode by which all phenomena are reasoned about and given precise and exact explanation. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely graded weights. (32) It is not that the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but that the latter is a much finer apparatus and of course much more accurate in its measurement than the former.<br>You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar examples. (33) You have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction (归纳法) and deduction, that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, manage to extract from Nature certain natural laws, and that out of these, by some special skill of their own, they build up their theories. (34) And it is imagined by many that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special training. To hear all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.<br>There is a well-known incident in one of Motiere’s plays, where the author makes the hero express unbounded delight on being told that he had been talking prose (散文) during the whole of his life. In the same way, I trust that you will take comfort, and be delighted with yourselves, on the discovery that you have been acting on the principles of inductive and deductive philosophy during the same period. (35)Probably there is not one here who has not in the course of the day had occasion to set in motion a complex train of reasoning, of the very same kind, though differing in degree, as that which a scientific man goes through in tracing the causes of natural phenomena.</p><p>Part Ⅳ Writing (15 points)</p><p>DIRECTIONS:<br>A.

It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable price, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labor, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television licence would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more.<br>And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does what is claimed for it, and that it represents good value.<br>Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can think of.<br>There is one more point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade.<br> If its message were confined merely to information—and that in itself would be difficult if not impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly persuasive—advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps that is what the well-known television personality wants.<br>11.By the first sentence of the passage the author means that.<br>[A] he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising[B] everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming<br>[C] advertising costs money like everything else[D] it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising<br>12.In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the advantages of advertising?<br>[A] Securing greater fame. [B] Providing more jobs.<br>[C] Enhancing living standards.[D] Reducing newspaper cost.<br>13.The author deems that the well-known TV personality is_.<br>[A] very precise in passing his judgment on advertising<br>[B] interested in nothing but the buyers’ attention<br>[C] correct in telling the difference between persuasion and information<br>[D] obviously partial in his views on advertising<br>14.In the author’s opinion,.<br>[A] advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by providing information<br>[B] advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them over<br>[C] there is nothing wrong with advertising in persuading the buyer<br>[D] the buyer is not interested in getting information from an advertisement</p><h2 id="Passage-2"><a href="#Passage-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 2"></a>Passage 2</h2><p>There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be identified and measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language—all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts.<br>By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since by definition it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept.<br>In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may “fail” at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability to grow. Do we perceive ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we’re shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until we know the ground is safe. Do we think we’re slow to adapt to change or that we’re not smart enough to cope with a new challenge? Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all.<br>These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow. If we do not confront and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell of our own making.<br>15 .A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth when.<br>[A] he has given up his smoking habit[B] he has made great efforts in his work<br>[C] he is keen on learning anything new[D] he has tried to determine where he is on his journey<br>16.In the author’s eyes, one who views personal growth as a process would.<br>[A] succeed in climbing up the social ladder[B] judge his ability to grow from his own achievements<br>[C] face difficulties and take up challenges[D] aim high and reach his goal each time<br>17.When the author says “a new way of being” (line 3, Para. 3) he is referring to.<br>[A] a new approach to experiencing the world      [B] a new way of taking risks<br>[C] a new method of perceiving ourselves         [D] a new system of adaptation to change<br>18.For personal growth, the author advocates all of the following except_.<br>[A] curiosity about more chances                [B] promptness in self-adaptation<br>[C] open-mindedness to new experiences          [D] avoidance of internal fears and doubts</p><h2 id="Passage-3"><a href="#Passage-3" class="headerlink" title="Passage 3"></a>Passage 3</h2><p>In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become complicated. Many of life’s problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people today.<br>In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War Ⅱ. As families move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be consciously learned.<br>Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one piece of information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated, time-consuming and sometimes even overwhelming .<br>Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information. Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared world wide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving their homes and&#x2F;or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information available to more people.<br>In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed. “Knowledge is power” may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most critical requirement of all people.<br>19.The word “it” (line 3, Para. 2) most probably refers to.<br>[A] the lack of stable communities      [B] the breakdown of informal information channels<br>[C] the increased mobility of families    [D] the growing number of people moving from place to place<br>20.The main problem people may encounter today arises form the fact that.<br>[A] they have to learn new things consciously<br>[B] they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information<br>[C] they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily<br>[D] they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family.<br>21.From the passage we can infer that.<br>[A] electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages<br>[B] it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era<br>[C] people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences<br>[D] events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites<br>22.We can learn from the last paragraph that .<br>[A] it is necessary to obtain as much<br>[B] people should make the best use of the information<br>[C] we should realize the importance of accumulating information .<br>[D] it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently</p><h2 id="Passage-4"><a href="#Passage-4" class="headerlink" title="Passage 4"></a>Passage 4</h2><p>Personality is to a large extent inherent—A-type parents usually bring about A-type offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is important to the parents; it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.<br>One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the ‘win at all costs’ moral standard and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system , in which competitive A types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon runner, dropped dead seconds after saying: “Rejoice, we conquer!”<br>By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful.<br>Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A youngsters change into B’s. The world needs types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child’s personality to his possible future employment. It is top management.<br>If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine, could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from A type stock. B’s are important and should be encouraged.<br>23.According to the passage, A-type individuals are usually.<br>[A] impatient [B] considerate [C] aggressive [D] agreeable<br>24.The author is strongly opposed to the practice of examinations at schools because.<br>[A] the pressure is too great on the students[B] some students are bound to fail<br>[C] failure rates are too high[D] the results of exanimations are doubtful<br>25.The selection of medical professionals are currently based on.<br>[A] candidates’ sensitivity [B] academic achievements<br>[C] competitive spirit[D] surer values<br>26.From the passage we can draw the conclusion that.<br>[A] the personality of a child is well established at birth<br>[B] family influence dominates the shaping of one’ s characteristics .<br>[C] the development of one’ s personality is due to multiple factors<br>[D] B-type characteristics can find no place in competitive society<br>Passage 5<br>That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but nevertheless remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the function popularly named memory. Constant practice has such as effect on memory as to lead to skillful performance on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and understanding these words. So-called intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering being a primary requirement for reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists depends on memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on remembering many earlier experiences.<br>Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned material. Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting can seem to be adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be interpreted to have survived through a process of natural selection in animals. Indeed, when one’s memory of an emotionally painful experience leads to serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation might make it difficult to understand how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived natural selection.<br>In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is helpful to consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in time, since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues for inferring duration. Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer; for example, learned behaviour that might have been correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of confusion. This forgetting seems to serve that survival of the individual and the species.<br>Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there is evidence that the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they have learned. Such data offers gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output balance.<br>27.From the evolutionary point of view, .<br>[A] forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive.<br>[B] if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very adaptive<br>[C] the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an individual’ s adaptability<br>[D] sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences<br>28.According to the passage, if a person never forgot .<br>[A] he would survive best                 [B] he would have a lot of trouble<br>[C] his ability to learn would be enhanced    [D] the evolution of memory would stop<br>29.From the last paragraph we know that.<br>[A] forgetfulness is a response to learning<br>[B] the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output system<br>[C] memory is a compensation for forgetting<br>[D] the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because forgetting occurs<br>30.In this article, the author tries to interpret the function of__.<br>[A] remembering [B] forgetting [C] adapting [D] experiencing</p><h1 id="Part-Ⅲ-English-Chinese-Translation"><a href="#Part-Ⅲ-English-Chinese-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Part Ⅲ English-Chinese Translation"></a>Part Ⅲ English-Chinese Translation</h1><p>The standardized educational or psychological test that are widely used to aid in selecting, classifying, assigning, or promoting students, employees, and military personnel have been the target of recent attacks in books, magazines, the daily press, and even in congress. (31) The target is wrong, for in attacking the tests, critics divert attention form the fault that lies with ill-informed or incompetent users. The tests themselves are merely tools, with characteristics that can be measured with reasonable precision under specified conditions. Whether the results will be valuable, meaningless, or even misleading depends partly upon the tool itself but largely upon the user.<br>All informed predictions of future performance are based upon some knowledge of relevant past performance: school grades, research productivity, sales records, or whatever is appropriate. (32 )How well the predictions will be validated by later performance depends upon the amount , reliability , and appropriateness of the information used and on the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted. Anyone who keeps careful score knows that the information available is always incomplete and that the predictions are always subject to error.<br>Standardized tests should be considered in this context. They provide a quick, objective method of getting some kinds of information about what a person learned, the skills he has developed, or the kind of person he is. The information so obtained has, qualitatively, the same advantages and shortcomings as other kinds of information. (33) Whether to use tests. other kinds of information, or both in a particular situation depends, therefore, upon the evidence from experience concerning comparative validity and upon such factors as cost and availability.<br>(34) In general, the tests work most effectively when the qualities to be measured can be most precisely defined and least effectively when what is to be measured or predicted cannot be well defined. Properly used, they provide a rapid means of getting comparable information about many people. Sometimes they identify students whose high potential has not been previously recognized, but there are many things they do not do. (35) For example, they do not compensate for gross social inequality, and thus do not tell how able an underprivileged youngster might have been had he grown up under more favorable circumstances.</p><h1 id="Part-Ⅳ-Writing-15-points"><a href="#Part-Ⅳ-Writing-15-points" class="headerlink" title="Part Ⅳ Writing (15 points)"></a>Part Ⅳ Writing (15 points)</h1><p>DIRECTIONS:<br>A.

Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.<br>An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system.<br>The important factor in a private enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property) , and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.<br>11.In Line 11, Para 1, “the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes” means__.<br>[A] Americans are never satisfied with their incomes<br>[B] Americans tend to overstate their incomes<br>[C] Americans want to have their incomes increased<br>[D] Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes<br>12.The first two sentences in the second paragraph tell us that__.<br>[A] producers can satisfy the consumers by mechanized production<br>[B] consumers can express their demands through producers<br>[C] producers decide the prices of products<br>[D] supply and demand regulate prices<br>13.According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is characterized by__.<br>[A] private property and rights concerned [B] manpower and natural resources control<br>[C] ownership of productive resources [D] free contracts and prices<br>14.The passage is mainly about__.<br>[A] how American goods are produced [B] how American consumers buy their goods<br>[C] how American economic system works [D] how American businessmen make their profits </p><h2 id="Passage-2"><a href="#Passage-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 2"></a>Passage 2</h2><p>One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the “cashless society” is not on the horizon—it’s already here.<br>While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also identify preferred customers for promotional. Computers are relied on by manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.<br>Numerous other commercial enterprises, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through the use of computers.<br>15.According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to__.<br>[A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes [B] obtain more convenient services than other people do<br>[C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper [D] cash money wherever he wishes to<br>16.From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that __.<br>[A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards [B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today<br>[C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash       [D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before<br>17.The phrase “ring up sales” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means “___”.<br>[A] make an order of goods [B] record sales on a cash register<br>[C] call the sales manager [D] keep track of the goods in stock<br>18.What is this passage mainly about?<br>[A] Approaches to the commercial use of computers.

[D] Advantages of credit cards in business. </p><h2 id="Passage-3"><a href="#Passage-3" class="headerlink" title="Passage 3"></a>Passage 3</h2><p>Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. For these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be adapted to those differences.<br>Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both the family and the society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and development. And it is in the public schools that we find the full expression of society’ s understanding—the knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next generation.<br>Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that minor we can see the strengths, the weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the culture itself. The great interest in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades indicates the strong feeling in our society that all citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.<br>“All men are created equal.” We’ve heard it many times, but it still has important meaning for education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this country’s founders to denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to mean equality of opportunity. That concept implies educational opportunity for all children—the right of each child to receive help in learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court decisions have confirmed the right of all children—disabled or not—to an appropriate education, and have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to provide that education. In response, schools are modifying their programs, adapting instruction to children who are exceptional, to those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.<br>19.In Paragraph 2, the author cites the example of the leading actor on the stage to show that _<strong><strong>.<br>[A] the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their family and the society<br>[B] exceptional children are more influenced by their families than normal children are<br>[C] exceptional children are the key interest of the family and society<br>[D] the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of the exceptional children<br>20.The reason that the exceptional children receive so much concern in education is that</strong>.<br>[A] they are expected to be leaders of the society [B] they might become a burden of the society<br>[C] they should fully develop their potentials [D] disabled children deserve special consideration<br>21.This passage mainly deals with</strong>.<br>[A] the differences of children in their learning capabilities<br>[B] the definition of exceptional children in modern society<br>[C] the special educational programs for exceptional children<br>[D] the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children<br>22.From this passage we learn that the educational concern for exceptional children ___.<br>[A] is now enjoying legal support [B] disagrees with the tradition of the country<br>[C] was clearly stated by the country’ s founders [D] will exert great influence over court decisions </p><h2 id="Passage-4"><a href="#Passage-4" class="headerlink" title="Passage 4"></a>Passage 4</h2><p>“I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we’ll know in vast detail how cancer cells arise,” says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. “But,” he cautions, “Some people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly follow. Consider Pasteur. He discovered the causes of many kinds of infections, but it was fifty or sixty years before cures were available. ”<br>This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer will survive at least five years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent. For some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But other survival statistics are still discouraging—13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for cancer of the pancreas (胰腺) .<br>With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer works is not easy. The researchers made great progress in the early 1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes, which are cancer-causing genes (基因), are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown. If several oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.<br>The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood that many cancers are initiated at the level of genes suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. “Changes are a normal part of the evolutionary process,” says oncologist William Haywar. Environmental factors can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points out, “We can’t prepare a medicine against cosmic rays.”<br>The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter.<br>“First, we need to understand how the normal cell controls itself. Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited number of genes in cells which are always responsible for at least part of the trouble. If we can understand how cancer works, we can counteract its action. “<br>23.The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to__.<br>[A]. predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade<br>[B] indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright<br>[C] prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years<br>[D] warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can be conquered<br>24.The author implies that by the year 2000, <strong>.<br>[A] there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate of skin-cancer patients<br>[B] 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be living<br>[C] the survival statistics will be fairly even among patients with various cancers<br>[D] there won’ t be a drastic increase of survival rate of all cancer patients<br>25.Oncogenes are cancer-causing genes</strong>.<br>[A] that are always in operation in a healthy person  [B] which remain unharmful so long as they are not activated<br>[C] that can be driven out of normal cells          [D] which normal cells can’ t turn off<br>26.The word “dormant” in the third paragraph most probably means__.<br>    [A] dead [B] ever-present [C] inactive [D] potential </p><h2 id="Passage-5"><a href="#Passage-5" class="headerlink" title="Passage 5"></a>Passage 5</h2><p>Discoveries in science and technology are thought by“untaught minds”to come in blinding flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have it, look at the mold (霉) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of laborious trial and error. Innovation is like soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently than they score.<br>The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal —and so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovation and others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs and they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.<br>“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there’ s no particular virtue in doing things the way they have always been done, “ wrote Rudolph Flesch, a language authority. This accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient: “How come nobody thought of that before?”<br>The creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears. Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.<br>Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.<br>27.What does the author probably mean by “untaught mind” in the first paragraph?<br>[A] A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation.<br>[B] A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity.<br>[C] A person who has had no education.<br>[D] An individual who often comes up with new ideas by accident.<br>28.According to the author, what distinguishes innovators from non-innovators?<br>[A] The variety of ideas they have.[B] The intelligence they possess.<br>[C] The way they deal with problems.

(31) Science moves forward, they say, not so much through the insights of great men of genius as because of more ordinary things like improved techniques and tools. (32) “In short”, a leader of the new school contends, “the scientific revolution, as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and use of a series of instruments that expanded the reach of science in innumerable directions.”<br>(33)Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source of fundamental innovation have largely been ignored by historians and philosophers of science. The modern school that hails technology argues that such masters as Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and inventors such as Edison attached great importance to, and derived great benefit from, craft information and technological devices of different kinds that were usable in scientific experiments.<br>The centerpiece of the argument of a technology-yes, genius-no advocate was an analysis of Galileo’s role at the start of the scientific revolution. The wisdom of the day was derived from Ptolemy, an astronomer of the second century, whose elaborate system of the sky put Earth at the center of all heavenly motions. (34) Galileo’s greatest glory was that in 1609 he was the first person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens to prove that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth. But the real hero of the story, according to the new school of scientists, was the long evolution in the improvement of machinery for making eye-glasses.<br>Federal policy is necessarily involved in the technology vs. genius dispute. (35)Whether the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa (反之) often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force. </p><h1 id="Part-Ⅳ-Writing-15-points"><a href="#Part-Ⅳ-Writing-15-points" class="headerlink" title="Part Ⅳ Writing (15 points)"></a>Part Ⅳ Writing (15 points)</h1><p>DIRECTIONS:<br>A.

If we intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide which food to cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to be served.<br>Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and write a brief account of yourself. In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.<br>This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life and should include education, experience and references. Such an account is valuable. It can be referred to in filling out standard application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews. While talking to you, your could be employer is deciding whether your education, your experience, and other qualifications will pay him to employ you and your “wares” and abilities must be displayed in an orderly and reasonably connected manner.<br>When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt for a job. Get all the possible information about your could be job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and the firm. Keep your eyes and ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain amount of time each day seeking the employment you wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a job is your job now. </p><p>11.What do the elders mean when they say, “It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”?<br>［A］ You’ll certainly get what you want.<br>［B］ It’s no use dreaming.<br>［C］ You should be dissatisfied with what you have.<br>［D］ It’s essential to set a goal for yourself.<br>12.A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used in this passage as         .<br>［A］ an illustration of how to write an application for a job<br>［B］ an indication of how to secure a good job<br>［C］ a guideline for job description<br>［D］ a principle for job evaluation<br>13.According to the passage, one must write an account of himself before starting to find a job because         .<br>［A］ that is the first step to please the employer<br>［B］ that is the requirement of the employer<br>［C］ it enables him to know when to sell his services<br>［D］ it forces him to become clearly aware of himself<br>14.When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something        .<br>［A］ definite to offer［B］ imaginary to provide<br>［C］ practical to supply［D］ desirable to present</p><h2 id="Passage-2"><a href="#Passage-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 2"></a>Passage 2</h2><p>With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America can now watch the Corporation’s news coverage, as well as listen to it.<br>And of course in Britain listeners and viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, five BBC national radio services and dozens of local radio stations. They are brought sport, comedy, drama, music, news and current affairs, education, religion, parliamentary coverage, children’s programmes and films for an annual licence fee of ￡83 per household.<br>It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years — yet the BBC’s future is now in doubt. The Corporation will survive as a publiclyfunded broadcasting organization, at least for the time being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nationwide debate in Britain.<br>The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with an opinion of the BBC — including ordinary listeners and viewers — to say what was good or bad about the Corporation, and even whether they thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC’s royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the organization as it is, or to make changes.<br>Defenders of the Corporation — of whom there are many — are fond of quoting the American slogan “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The BBC “ain’t broke”, they say, by which they mean it is not broken (as distinct from the word  ‘broke’, meaning having no money), so why bother to change it?<br>Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing. The commercial TV channels —— ITV and Channel 4 —— were required by the Thatcher Government’s Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for advertisers, and cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels — funded partly by advertising and partly by viewers’subscriptions — which will bring about the biggest changes in the long term.</p><p>15.The world famous BBC now faces         .<br>［A］ the problem of news coverage［B］ an uncertain prospect<br>［C］ inquiries by the general public［D］ shrinkage of audience<br>16.In the passage, which of the following about the BBC is not mentioned as the key issue?<br>［A］ Extension of its TV service to Far East.<br>［B］ Programmes as the subject of a nation-wide debate.<br>［C］ Potentials for further international co-operations.<br>［D］ Its existence as a broadcasting organization.<br>17.The BBC’s “royal charter” (Line 4, Paragraph 4) stands for         .<br>［A］ the financial support from the royal family.<br>［B］ the privileges granted by the Queen.<br>［C］ a contract with the Queen.<br>［D］ a unique relationship with the royal family.<br>18.The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no other than         .<br>［A］ the emergence of commercial TV channels.<br>［B］ the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government.<br>［C］ the urgent necessity to reduce costs and jobs.<br>［D］ the challenge of new satellite channels.</p><h2 id="Passage-3"><a href="#Passage-3" class="headerlink" title="Passage 3"></a>Passage 3</h2><p>In the last half of the nineteenth century “capital” and “labour” were enlarging and perfecting their rival organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a limited liability company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the technical requirements of the new age by engaging a large professional element and prevented the decline in efficiency that so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in the second and third generation after the energetic founders. It was moreover a step away from individual initiative, towards collectivism and municipal and state-owned business. The railway companies, though still private business managed for the benefit of shareholders, were very unlike old family business. At the same time the great municipalities went into business to supply lighting, trams and other services to the taxpayers.<br>The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management of business. All through the nineteenth century, America, Africa, India, Australia and parts of Europe were being developed by British capital, and British shareholders were thus enriched by the world’s movement towards industrialization. Towns like Bournemouth and Eastbourne sprang up to house large “comfortable” classes who had retired on their incomes, and who had no relation to the rest of the community except that of drawing dividends and occasionally attending a shareholders’ meeting to dictate their orders to the management. On the other hand “shareholding” meant leisure and freedom which was used by many of the later Victorians for the highest purpose of a great civilization.<br>The “shareholders” as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts or needs of the workmen employed by the company in which he held shares, and his influence on the relations of capital and labor was not good. The paid manager acting for the company was in more direct relation with the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that familiar personal knowledge of the workmen which the employer had often had under the more patriarchal system of the old family business now passing away. Indeed the mere size of operations and the numbers of workmen involved rendered such personal relations impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing power and organization of the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on equal terms the managers of the companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike and lockout taught the two parties to respect each other’s strength and understand the value of fair negotiation.</p><p>19.It’s true of the old family firms that         .<br>［A］ they were spoiled by the younger generations<br>［B］ they failed for lack of individual initiative<br>［C］ they lacked efficiency compared with modern companies<br>［D］ they could supply adequate services to the taxpayers<br>20.The growth of limited liability companies resulted in         .<br>［A］ the separation of capital from management<br>［B］ the ownership of capital by managers<br>［C］ the emergence of capital and labour as two classes<br>［D］ the participation of shareholders in municipal business<br>21.According to the passage, all of the following are true except that         .<br>［A］ the shareholders were unaware of the needs of the workers<br>［B］ the old firm owners had a better understanding of their workers<br>［C］ the limited liability companies were too large to run smoothly<br>［D］ the trade unions seemed to play a positive role<br>22.The author is most critical of         .<br>［A］ family firm owners［B］ landowners<br>［C］ managers［D］ shareholders</p><h2 id="Passage-4"><a href="#Passage-4" class="headerlink" title="Passage 4"></a>Passage 4</h2><p>What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America— breakthroughs such as the telegraph, the steamboat and the weaving machine?<br>Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country’s excellent elementary schools; a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors; and above all the American genius for nonverbal, “spatial” thinking about things technological.<br>Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics, especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at home in arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.<br>Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this educational advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported, “With a mind prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into the skilled workman.”<br>A further stimulus to invention came from the “premium” system, which preceded our patent system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, offered inventors medals, cash prizes and other incentives.<br>In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs and at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new machines and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.<br>Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took readily to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson has pointed out, “A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced to unambiguous verbal descriptions; they are dealt with in his mind by a visual, nonverbal process … The designer and the inventor … are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not exist.”<br>This nonverbal “spatial” thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert Fulton once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc, like a poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which a new arrangement transmits a new idea.”<br>When all these shaping forces—schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for spatial thinking —interacted with one another on the rich U.S. mainland, they produced that American characteristic emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier times it meant a friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.</p><p>23.According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions in early America was in a large part due to         .<br>［A］ elementary schools［B］ enthusiastic workers<br>［C］ the attractive premium system ［D］ a special way of thinking<br>24.It is implied that adaptiveness and inventiveness of the early American mechanics        .<br>［A］ benefited a lot from their mathematical knowledge.<br>［B］ shed light on disciplined school management.<br>［C］ was brought about by privileged home training.<br>［D］ owed a lot to the technological development.<br>25.A technologist can be compared to an artist because         .<br>［A］ they are both winners of awards.［B］ they are both experts in spatial thinking.<br>［C］ they both abandon verbal description［D］ they both use various instruments<br>26.The best title for this passage might be         .<br>［A］ Inventive Mind［B］ Effective Schooling<br>［C］ Ways of Thinking［D］ Outpouring of Inventions</p><h2 id="Passage-5"><a href="#Passage-5" class="headerlink" title="Passage 5"></a>Passage 5</h2><p>Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism&#x2F;evolution are in the publisher’s pipelines. A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have provided a consistent, unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. “Scientific” creationism, which is being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of evolution are given, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of nonfundamentalist religious leaders have come to regard “scientific” creationism as bad science and bad religion.<br>The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In the last three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of their deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.<br>Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of his arguments. The non-specialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapters on the creationists will be extremely clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This book stands for reason itself.” And so it does - and all would be well were reason the only judge in the creationism&#x2F;evolution debate.<br>27.“Creationism” in the passage refers to         .<br>［A］ evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe<br>［B］ a notion of the creation of religion<br>［C］ the scientific explanation of the earth formation<br>［D］ the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe<br>28.Kitcher’s book is intended to         .<br>［A］ recommend the views of the evolutionists  ［B］ expose the true features of creationists<br>［C］ curse bitterly at his opponents            ［D］ launch a surprise attack on creationists<br>29.From the passage we can infer that         .<br>［A］ reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate<br>［B］ creationists do not base their argument on reasoning<br>［C］ evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists<br>［D］ creationism is supported by scientific findings<br>30.This passage appears to be a digest of         .<br>［A］ a book review［B］ a scientific paper<br>［C］ a magazine feature［D］ a newspaper editorial</p><h1 id="Part-ⅢEnglish—Chinese-Translation"><a href="#Part-ⅢEnglish—Chinese-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Part ⅢEnglish—Chinese Translation"></a>Part ⅢEnglish—Chinese Translation</h1><p>Directions:<br>Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)</p><p>The differences in relative growth of various areas of scientific research have several causes. 31）Some of these causes are completely reasonable results of social needs. Others are reasonable consequences of particular advances in science being to some extent self-accelerating. Some, however, are less reasonable processes of different growth in which preconceptions of the form scientific theory ought to take, by persons in authority, act to alter the growth pattern of different areas. This is a new problem probably not yet unavoidable; but it is a frightening trend. 32）This trend began during the Second World War, when several governments came to the conclusion that the specific demands that a government wants to make of its scientific establishment cannot generally be foreseen in detail. It can be predicted, however, that from time to time questions will arise which will require specific scientific answers. It is therefore generally valuable to treat the scientific establishment as a resource or machine to be kept in functional order. 33）This seems mostly effectively done by supporting a certain amount of research not related to immediate goals but of possible consequence in the future.<br>This kind of support, like all government support, requires decisions about the appropriate recipients of funds. Decisions based on utility as opposed to lack of utility are straightforward. But a decision among projects none of which has immediate utility is more difficult. The goal of the supporting agencies is the praisable one of supporting “good” as opposed to “bad” science, but a valid determination is difficult to make. Generally, the idea of good science tends to become confused with the capacity of the field in question to generate an elegant theory. 34）However, the world is so made that elegant systems are in principle unable to deal with some of the world’s more fascinating and delightful aspects. 35）New forms of thought as well as new subjects for thought must arise in the future as they have in the past, giving rise to new standards of elegance. </p><h1 id="Section-Ⅳ-Writing"><a href="#Section-Ⅳ-Writing" class="headerlink" title="Section Ⅳ Writing"></a>Section Ⅳ Writing</h1><p>36.Directions:<br>A.

(40 points)</p><h2 id="Passage-1"><a href="#Passage-1" class="headerlink" title="Passage 1"></a>Passage 1</h2><p>It was 3: 45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia’s Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group’s on-line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: “We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn’t just something that happened in Australia. It’s world history.”<br>The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill law has left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right-to-life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia—where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part—other states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where the right-to-die movement is gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling.<br>Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death—probably by a deadly injection or pill—to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill by two doctors. After a “cooling off” period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill law means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. “I’m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I’d go, because I’ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks, ” he says.</p><p>11.From the second paragraph we learn that        .<br>［A］ the objection to euthanasia is slow to come in other countries<br>［B］ physicians and citizens share the same view on euthanasia<br>［C］ changing technology is chiefly responsible for the hasty passage of the law<br>［D］ it takes time to realize the significance of the law’s passage<br>12.When the author says that observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling, he means        .<br>［A］ observers are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the future of euthanasia<br>［B］ similar bills are likely to be passed in the US, Canada and other countries<br>［C］ observers are waiting to see the result of the game of dominoes<br>［D］ the effect-taking process of the passed bill may finally come to a stop<br>13.When Lloyd Nickson dies, he will        .<br>［A］ face his death with calm characteristic of euthanasia<br>［B］ experience the suffering of a lung cancer patient<br>［C］ have an intense fear of terrible suffering<br>［D］ undergo a cooling off period of seven days<br>14.The author’s attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of        .<br>［A］ opposition［B］ suspicion［C］ approval［D］ indifference</p><h2 id="Passage-2"><a href="#Passage-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 2"></a>Passage 2</h2><p>A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.<br>For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of diversion, and brought news of the outside world.<br>The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: if you didn’t take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation.<br>Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. “I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner—amazing.” Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition.<br>As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to “translate” cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example, when an American uses the word “friend”, the cultural implications of the word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor’s language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many Americans value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers.</p><p>15.In the eyes of visitors from the outside world        ,.<br>［A］ rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US<br>［B］ small-minded officials deserve a serious comment<br>［C］ Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors<br>［D］ most Americans are ready to offer help<br>16.It could be inferred from the last paragraph that        .<br>［A］ culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship<br>［B］ courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated<br>［C］ various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends<br>［D］ social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural conventions<br>17.Families in frontier settlements used to entertain strangers        .<br>［A］ to improve their hard life［B］ in view of their long-distance travel<br>［C］ to add some flavor to their own daily life［D］ out of a charitable impulse<br>18.The tradition of hospitality to strangers        .<br>［A］ tends to be superficial and artificial［B］ is generally well kept up in the United States<br>［C］ is always understood properly［D］ has something to do with the busy tourist trails</p><h2 id="Passage-3"><a href="#Passage-3" class="headerlink" title="Passage 3"></a>Passage 3</h2><p>Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is a drug. Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal chemical taken by drug addicts. They don’t realize that familiar substances such as alcohol and tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used by many physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of “drug abuse” to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as heroin and cocaine.<br>We live in a society in which the medical and social use of substances (drugs) is pervasive: an aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently constructive uses of a substance become misuses? First of all, most substances taken in excess will produce negative effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance can also lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence is marked first by an increased tolerance, with more and more of the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued.<br>Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially speed up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants slow it down. Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including producing hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic (from the Greek word meaning “mind-manifestation”) because they seemed to radically alter one’s state of consciousness.</p><p>19.“Substance abuse”(Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable to “drug abuse” in that        .<br>［A］ substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if illegally used<br>［B］ “drug abuse” is only related to a limited number of drugtakers<br>［C］ alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine<br>［D］ many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be poisonous<br>20.The word “pervasive” (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean        .<br>［A］ widespread［B］ overwhelming<br>［C］ piercing［D］ fashionable<br>21.Physical dependence on certain substances results from        .<br>［A］ uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time<br>［B］ exclusive use of them for social purposes<br>［C］ quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases<br>［D］ careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms<br>22.From the last paragraph we can infer that        .<br>［A］ stimulants function positively on the mind<br>［B］ hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health<br>［C］ depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances<br>［D］ the three types of psychoactive substances were commonly used in groups</p><h2 id="Passage-4"><a href="#Passage-4" class="headerlink" title="Passage 4"></a>Passage 4</h2><p>No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline of a nation. “Is this what you intended to accomplish with your careers?” Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives last week. “You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and threaten our children as well?” At Time Warner, however, such questions are simply the latest manifestation of the soul-searching that has involved the company ever since the company was born in 1990. It’s a self-examination that has, at various times, involved issues of responsibility, creative freedom and the corporate bottom line.<br>At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took over for the late Steve Ross in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and reduce the company’s mountainous debt, which will increase to $ 17.3 billion after two new cable deals close. He has promised to sell off some of the property and restructure the company, but investors are waiting impatiently.<br>The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has consistently defended the company’s rap music on the grounds of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under fire for releasing Ice-T’s violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful expression of street culture, which deserves an outlet. “The test of any democratic society, ”he wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, “lies not in how well it can control expression but in whether it gives freedom of thought and expression the widest possible latitude, however disputable or irritating the results may sometimes be. We won’t retreat in the face of any threats.”<br>Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were signs that the chairman was backing off his hard-line stand, at least to some extent. During the discussion of rock singing verses at last month’s stockholders’ meeting, Levin asserted that “music is not the cause of society’s ills” and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses rap to communicate with students. But he talked as well about the “balanced struggle” between creative freedom and social responsibility, and he announced that the company would launch a drive to develop standards for distribution and labeling of potentially objectionable music.<br>The 15-member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate strategy. But insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter. “Some of us have known for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment are not totally unlimited, ” says Luce. “I think it is perhaps the case that some people associated with the company have only recently come to realize this.”</p><p>23.Senator Robert Dole criticized Time Warner for        .<br>［A］ its raising of the corporate stock price［B］ its self-examination of soul<br>［C］ its neglect of social responsibility［D］ its emphasis on creative freedom<br>24.According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?<br>［A］ Luce is a spokesman of Time Warner. ［B］ Gerald Levin is liable to compromise.<br>［C］ Time Warner is united as one in the face of the debate.［D］ Steve Ross is no longer alive<br>25.In face of the recent attacks on the company, the chairman        .<br>［A］ stuck to a strong stand to defend freedom of expression<br>［B］ softened his tone and adopted some new policy<br>［C］ changed his attitude and yielded to objection<br>［D］ received more support from the 15-member board<br>26.The best title for this passage might be        .<br>［A］ A Company under Fire［B］ A Debate on Moral Decline<br>［C］ A Lawful Outlet of Street Culture［D］ A Form of Creative Freedom</p><h2 id="Passage-5"><a href="#Passage-5" class="headerlink" title="Passage 5"></a>Passage 5</h2><p>Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a soft landing” or “a touch on the brakes”, makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long, variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear-view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.<br>Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late. Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below the double-digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.<br>It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists which The Economist polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995. In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and is expected to average only about 3% for the year as a whole. In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.<br>Economists have been particularly surprised by favourable inflation figures in Britain and the United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially America’s, have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilisation, for example, hit historically high levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen below most estimates of the natural rate of unemployment—the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past.<br>Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have up-ended the old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation.</p><p>27.From the passage we learn that        .<br>［A］ there is a definite relationship between inflation and interest rates<br>［B］ economy will always follow certain models<br>［C］ the economic situation is better than expected<br>［D］ economists had foreseen the present economic situation<br>28.According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?<br>［A］ Making monetary policies is comparable to driving a car.<br>［B］ An extremely low jobless rate will lead to inflation.<br>［C］ A high unemployment rate will result from inflation.<br>［D］ Interest rates have an immediate effect on the economy.<br>29.The sentence “This is no flash in the pan” (Line 5, Paragraph 3) means that        .<br>［A］ the low inflation rate will last for some time［B］ the inflation rate will soon rise<br>［C］ the inflation will disappear quickly［D］ there is no inflation at present<br>30.The passage shows that the author isthe present situation        .<br>［A］ critical of［B］ puzzled by<br>［C］ disappointed at［D］ amazed at</p><h1 id="Part-Ⅲ-English-Chinese-Translation"><a href="#Part-Ⅲ-English-Chinese-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Part Ⅲ English-Chinese Translation"></a>Part Ⅲ English-Chinese Translation</h1><p>Directions:<br>Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)<br>Do animals have rights? This is how the question is usually put. It sounds like a useful, ground-clearing way to start. 31）Actually, it isn’t, because it assumes that there is an agreed account of human rights, which is something the world does not have.<br>On one view of rights, to be sure, it necessarily follows that animals have none.32）Some philosophers argue that rights exist only within a social contract, as part of an exchange of duties and entitlements. Therefore animals cannot have rights. The idea of punishing a tiger that kills somebody is absurd, for exactly the same reason, so is the idea that tigers have rights. However, this is only one account, and by no means an uncontested one. It denies rights not only to animals but also to some people—for instance, to infants, the mentally incapable and future generations. In addition, it is unclear what force a contract can have for people who never consented to it: how do you reply to somebody who says “ I don’t like this contract”?<br>The point is this: without agreement on the rights of people, arguing about the rights of animals is fruitless.33）It leads the discussion to extremes at the outset: it invites you to think that animals should be treated either with the consideration humans extend to other humans, or with no consideration at all. This is a false choice. Better to start with another, more fundamental, question: is the way we treat animals a moral issue at all?<br>Many deny it.34）Arguing from the view that humans are different from animals in every relevant respect, extremists of this kind think that animals lie outside the area of moral choice. Any regard for the suffering of animals is seen as a mistake—a sentimental displacement of feeling that should properly be directed to other humans.<br>This view, which holds that torturing a monkey is morally equivalent to chopping wood, may seem bravely “logical”. In fact it is simply shallow: the confused centre is right to reject it. The most elementary form of moral reasoning—the ethical equivalent of learning to crawl—is to weigh other’s interests against one’s own. This in turn requires sympathy and imagination: without which there is no capacity for moral thought. To see an animal in pain is enough, for most, to engage sympathy.35）When that happens, it is not a mistake: it is mankind’s instinct for moral reasoning in action, an instinct that should be encouraged rather than laughed at.</p><h1 id="Section-ⅣWriting-15-points"><a href="#Section-ⅣWriting-15-points" class="headerlink" title="Section ⅣWriting(15 points)"></a>Section ⅣWriting(15 points)</h1><p>36.Directions:<br>A.
